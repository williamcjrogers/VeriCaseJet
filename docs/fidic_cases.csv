1,2025,"M/s Chennai Metro Rail v Transtonnelstroy, Original Petition No. 569 & 570 of 2017, 07 November 2025","High Court of Tamil Nadu at Madras (Chennai), India",1995 Orange,"This is a petition to set aside 2 arbitration awards in the High Court of Madras, in Tamil Nadu, India, relating to a contract for the design and construction of two underground stations and tunnels. During the operation of the contract, the government amended local law to impose liability on contractors to pay specific costs. Transtonnelstroy, the Contractor, challenged this in court separately, and asked Chennai Rail (the Employer) to cover these additional costs. Chennai Rail refused on the basis that Transtonnelstroy was not entitled. Transtonnelstroy then sought amicable settlement, which was also rejected, after which they sought arbitration. Transtonnelstroy argued that clauses 32 (which dealt with the price mechanism) and 37 (which dealt with variations to costs) were distinct provisions, and that clause 37 automatically kicked in when there was a change to legislation, regardless of the price mechanism changing under clause 32. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of Transtonnelstroy ('the Awards'), which led to the current proceedings where Chennai Rail applied to set the Awards. Chennai Rail argued that the Awards conflicted with the express terms of the contract, as clause 13.16 of the contract only allowed for 3 exceptions to changes in price due to legislative change; the Tribunal's interpretation made clause 13.16 redundant. Chennai Rail also claimed that Transtonnelstroy's compensation had already been covered under clause 32, and additional compensation under clause 37 would be patently illegal and contrary to public policy. Transtonnelstroy responded by arguing that clause 13.16 was not only restricted to the 3 exceptions, and that it should be interpreted flexibly to include other reasons for cost increases due to legislative change. Transtonnelstroy defended the Tribunal's findings as reasonable and a plausible interpretation of the contract. The court agreed with Transtonnelstroy that clauses 32 and 37 were intended for different purposes, and also that clause 13.16 was correctly worded. However, the court also considered that it was unreasonable for a contractor to claim for additional costs which had already been compensated under the contract, as was the case with Transtonnelstroy under clause 32. As such, the Tribunal had violated public policy and legislation in finding that Transtonnelstroy were entitled to additional compensation under clause 37. The court set aside the Awards with costs in favour of Chennai Rail.",Link,https://www.casemine.com/judgement/in/690e3511a650582082d3244e
1,2025,Gordon Winter Company Ltd v NH International (Caribbean) Ltd (Trinidad and Tobago) [2025] UKPC 52 (30 October 2025),Privy Council,1999 (Colour not specified),"This is an appeal to the Privy Council against a decision by the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago, relating to a subcontract for piling work for the construction of a building. NH International (NH or the Contractor) contracted with the Ministry of Education of Trinidad and Tobago (the Employer) for the construction of a ten-storey building. NH subcontracted the piling works to Gordon Winter. The piling works were more difficult than expected due to soil conditions. As such the specification of the works had to be changed. After carrying out some of the works, Gordon Winter terminated the contract, having only received partial payment. Gordon Winter claimed against NH for damages on quantum meruit basis, arguing that NH had been unjustly enriched to Gordon Winter's disadvantage. NH counterclaimed for repudiatory breach of contract. The court of first instance considered that Gordon Winter could not succeed on their original argument of unjust enrichment as their claims were governed by the contract. The court of first instance found that Gordon Winter was entitled to full payment of the works completed, while NH was also entitled to damages for repudiatory breach. Gordon Winter appealed to the Court of Appeal, which also found Gordon Winter to be in repudiatory breach. The Court found that Gordon Winter could not prove unjust enrichment by NH; as such, the appeal failed. The Court also decided that Gordon Winter's other claims had merit and were to be assessed by a Master. NH challenged the Court of Appeal’s award, arguing that NH had been denied a fair chance to respond. The Privy Council dismissed the appeal, finding NH had in the prior proceedings itself relied on the existence of a contract, Gordon Winter had signalled an alternative contractual claim during proceedings, and no viable defences were available. The Privy Council also rejected arguments based on estoppel and election, noting Gordon Winter was entitled to plead alternatives. It concluded that Gordon Winter’s entitlement was valid under either express or implied contractual terms, and no injustice had occurred. The Privy Council also dismissed NH’s argument that a contractual quantum meruit must be based on an implied term, affirming that it can arise from either express or implied terms.",Link,https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=uk/cases/UKPC/2025/52.html&query=fidic
1,2025,"National Highways Authority Of India vs Hindustan Construction Co.Ltd on 16 October, 2025","High Court of Delhi at New Delhi, India",Not specified,"This is a petition to set aside an arbitral award in the Delhi High Court in India, relating to a contract for the road works in Uttar Pradesh, from Lucknow to Ayodhya. The National Highways Authority (NHA or the Employer) hired Hindustan Construction Co, the Contractor, for the development of a highway. The works were finished 3 years after the agreed contract completion date, with Hindustan Construction needing several extensions of time to complete the works. Hindustan Construction brought arbitration proceedings against NHA due to a dispute over payment for additional costs that arose in the additional 3 years. An Arbitral Tribunal awarded Hindustan Construction a sum and 12% monthly compound interest for prolongation costs. NHA sought to set aside the award on the following grounds: 1) the Tribunal had exceeded the contract terms by ignoring clauses restricting price escalation and compensation; 2) the delays were Hindustan Construction's fault due to poor mobilisation, planning and equipment, as such NHA should not have been liable for the project prolongation; 3) the award was perverse and arbitrary, as the Tribunal chose to selectively consider and ignore evidence such as Engineer's Reports and Chartered Accountant Certificates; 4) price adjustment was already provided for under clause 70 and Hindustan Construction should not be allowed to pursue double recovery; and 5) the interest rate awarded was excessive and unreasonable. Hindustan Construction opposed the petition on grounds that: 1) under national legislation, the court had limited scope to set aside an award and the court was not empowered to reconsider evidence (e.g. the Tribunal's interpretation of the contract) in the case; 2) the delays were not attributable to Hindustan Construction as the Engineer confirmed their entitlement to extensions of time, which were granted without liquidated damages; 3) clauses 6.4, 12.2, and 42.2 allowed for compensation due to Employer- caused delay; 4) Chartered Accountant Certificates constituted valid evidence and had been accepted in prior disputes; and 5) the interest rate awarded was justified based on clause 60.8 and restitution principles. The court agreed with Hindustan Construction that the court was limited in its ability to consider the Tribunal's findings of fact: the court was only empowered to interfere in grounds of patent illegality, perversity, or violation of public policy. The court also agreed with Hindustan Construction that the delays in the project were attributable to NHA, rather than Hindustan Construction, and that compensation beyond price escalation was indeed permissible under clauses 6.4, 12.2, 42.2. Further, Hindustan Construction's reliance on Chartered Accountant Certificates was valid, as was the awarded interest rate under clause 60.8. However, the court also found in favour of NHA, finding that the Tribunal had wrongly disregarded the Engineer's Reports, particularly in regard to plant and machinery costs. As such, the part of the award relating to plant and machinery costs was set aside, while the remainder (approximately half of the original award) was upheld.",Link,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/183501533/
2,2025,"JSC Power Machines v. Vietnam Oil and Gas Group and PetroVietnam Technical Service Corporation, SIAC Case No. ARB274/19/AB, Judgment of the Court of Appeal of Singapore [2025] SGCA 50 - 10 Oct 2025",Court of Appeal of Singapore,1999 Silver,"This is a judgment in the High Court of Singapore. The case concerns an application by the respondent (PVN or the Employer) in an arbitral award (discussed elsewhere in this table) to restrain the appellant (Power Machines or the Contractor) from enforcing previously granted arbitral awards globally, pending the conclusion of Singapore court proceedings to set aside enforcement decisions and the awards themselves. The underlying contract related to a large-scale energy and civil infrastructure project, and the arbitration was seated in Singapore under SIAC Rules. This is a judgment in the Court of Appeal of Singapore. The case concerns a dispute arising from a contract for the construction of a thermal power plant in Vietnam. The contract was governed by Vietnamese law and contained an arbitration clause referring disputes to SIAC arbitration in Singapore. Power Machines, a Russian company, and PetroVietnam Technical Service Corporation (PTSC), a Vietnamese company, together made up a Consortium of Contractors and entered into a contract with Vietnam Oil & Gas Group (PVN or the Employer) in 2014 for the construction of a power plant in Vietnam (the Project), which commenced in 2015. The imposition of US sanctions on Russian companies in 2014, which included Power Machines, led to Power Machines' subcontractors being affected and suspending their work on the Project in 2018. This ultimately led to a dispute over termination and related costs and damages (discussed elsewhere in this table), which was decided in an arbitral award. The arbitral tribunal issued a Final Award largely in PM’s favour, holding that the first notice was invalid but that the second notice validly terminated the contract. PVN applied to set aside the award, arguing breach of natural justice and excess of jurisdiction. The High Court found that the tribunal’s reasoning—specifically its conclusion that the second notice “overrode and superseded” the first—had no nexus to the parties’ cases and breached the fair hearing rule. Instead of setting aside the award, the Judge ordered remission to the tribunal under Article 34(4) of the UNCITRAL Model Law. On appeal, PM challenged the finding of breach, while PVN challenged the remission order. PM argued there was no breach of natural justice, claiming the tribunal’s reasoning was foreseeable and based on issues addressed during arbitration. It cited expert evidence on consecutive termination notices, asserted PVN suffered no prejudice, and maintained the tribunal acted within its mandate to draw reasonable inferences from presented arguments. PVN argued the tribunal breached natural justice by adopting unforeseeable reasoning contrary to both parties’ cases, causing prejudice. It claimed the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction, as the issue was never pleaded. PVN opposed remission, citing procedural defects, risk of bias, centrality of the breach, and unfair need for PM to amend pleadings. The Court of Appeal held that the tribunal’s reasoning at para 548 of the Final Award was unforeseeable, contrary to PM’s pleaded position, and unsupported by expert evidence, thereby breaching natural justice. The court also found that remission was inappropriate because the breach was serious, central to liability, and raised concerns of prejudgment. The court clarified principles on the fair hearing rule, scope of submission and procedural requirements for remission under local law. The Court of Appeal dismissed PM’s appeal, allowed PVN’s appeal, set aside the remission order, and struck out para 548 of the Final Award and consequential findings.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-jsc-power-machines-v-vietnam-oil-and-gas-group-and-petrovietnam-technical-service-corporation-judgment-of-the-court-of-appeal-of-singapore-2025-sgca-50-friday-10th-october-2025#decision_84401

Rosslyn Suites filed court proceedings against Bowman Associates due to grievances relating to variations and changes in valuation of works under the contract. Bowman Associates objected to the filing of these proceedings and challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear the suit on grounds that clause 20.4 of the contract required parties to refer any dispute to arbitration than the courts. Rosslyn Suites argued that Bowman Associates' notice of objection was misplaced as Rosslyn Suites were appointed as the Architect in the project, and therefore were not subject to the FIDIC contract as they were not a party to it. The court dismissed the notice, finding that Rosslyn Suites were in fact not party to the contract, and therefore clause 20.4 of the contract could not be binding on them.",Link,https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/kehc/2025/13436/eng@2025-09-25

SANRAL (the South African Roads Agency), the Employer, contracted with Fountain Civil Engineering (Fountain), the Contractor to carry out roadworks. Fountain subcontracted part of the works to Actophambili Roads, the Sub-Contractor (Actophambili). Actophambili completed part of the works and was paid, after which Fountain and Actophambili mutually agreed to cancel the contract. After the cancellation, Actophambili issued 3 more invoices, which Fountain disputed and refused to pay. Actophambili then sued Fountain for payment in the courts. In defence, Fountain argued that they did not owe the amount Actophambili was claiming for; that Actophambili's work was defective; and that Actophambili's 3 invoices were non-compliant with clause 3.6 of the contract. Fountain counterclaimed for damages to cover remedying the defective works and liquidated damages for delayed completion of the works. The court of first instance decided in favour of Actophambili, dismissing Fountain's reliance on clause 3.6 as 'opportunistic' and not considering the counterclaim. In these proceedings, Fountain filed an appeal to challenge the judgment. Fountain argued that Actophambili had not discharged the burden of proving their compliance with the contract, and argued that Actophambili was not entitled to enforce payment without proof and certification of the works completed. Fountain also argued that their reliance on clause 3.6, and challenged the court of first instance's decision to prioritise past conduct between the parties over the contract terms. Actophambili responded to the appeal by arguing that Fountain should not be able to rely on compliance with a formality to avoid liability for payment, and also that Fountain was trying to rely on defences not raised in the first instance, and finally that Fountain had not discharged the onus of proving its special defence in appealing. The High Court found that clause 3.6 was undisputed and required certified payment certificates for payment to be made. Actophambili's invoices had not been certified and lacked important source documentation, and further Actophambili had not followed the correct dispute resolution procedure under clause 20 of the contract. The High Court also found that the trial court had erred in relyng on past conduct between the parties rather than on enforcing the contract. As such, the appeal was upheld, the original judgment set aside, and a sum was awarded to Fountain. However, the court dismissed Fountain's application for liquidated damages.",Link,https://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAKZPHC/2025/99.pdf
2,2025,National Irrigation Authority formerly the National Irrigation Board v Satom SA (Civil Appeal E933 of 2023) [2025] KECA 1472 (KLR) (12 September 2025),Court of Appeal of Kenya at Nairobi,2010 Pink,"This is an appeal in the Kenya High Court against a prior court judgment, relating to a contract for irrigation and construction works for two canals in Kenya. The National Irrigation Authority (NIA), the Employer, entered into a contract with Sogea-Satom (aka Sogea) for the works. Disputes arose and, in line with clause 20.4 of the contract, were referred to a Dispute Board (DB). The DB issued 4 decisions requiring NIA to pay Sogea for outstanding payments, 2 of which were final and binding. Sogea later terminated the contract for non-payment, and applied to the High Court to enforce the DB decisions. NIA applied to stay the proceedings on the basis that Sogea had failed to exhaust the mandatory dispute resolution mechanisms preceding litigation under clause 20 of the contract. The High Court held that the DB decisions were enforceable under the “pay now, argue later” principle and rejected NIA's application to stay proceedings. NIA appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing: 1) the High Court had erred by refusing to refer the matter to arbitration despite a valid arbitration clause; 2) the DB decisions were invalid after the termination of the contract and contravened local laws; 3) the decision of summary judgment was improper as there were triable issues at hand; and 4) the court lacked jurisdiction due to the dispute resolution mechanism under clause 20 requiring arbitration to be attempted before resorting to court proceedings. Sogea opposed the appeal on the following grounds: 1) NIA's stay application in the High Court was time-barred according to local law; 2) there was no live dispute to refer to arbitration as the DB decisions were already enforceable and so NIA could not avoid prompt payment under the “pay now, argue later” principle; and 3) Sogea was entitled to summary judgment as there was no live dispute and NIA had no real defence to non-payment of the DB awards. Although the Court of Appeal agreed with NIA that failing to comply with clause 20's dispute resolution mechanism was cause to stay proceedings, they also noted that NIA's stay application was time-barred and therefore NIA had lost the right to make the application. The Court of Appeal also noted that DB jurisdiction survives contract termination; the parties had agreed to be bound by the DB even after termination of the contract. Finally, the Court of Appeal found that the High Court granting summary judgment was proper as there was no triable issue at hand; the DB decisions were enforceable unless overturned by arbitration. The Court of Appeal dismissed NIA's appeal with costs to Sogea, and upheld enforcement of the DB decisions.",Link,https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/keca/2025/1472/eng@2025-09-12
3,2025,"Case No. A40-208566/24-80-1434, 11 September 2025","Arbitration Court of Moscow City, Russia",Not specified,"This is a cassation appeal against a previous appellate decision (dated 22 May 2025, elsewhere in this table) challenging a court of first instance decision (featured elsewhere in this table) dated 10 March 2025. The original contract was for the development and operation of a highway in Russia. The language of this case is Russian. The first instance proceedings constituted an application for penalty for late payment by the Employer (the Respondent) of an arbitral award. The court of first instance denied the claim, citing the expired limitation period. The Appeal Court overturned the court of first instance's decision as it found that the limitation period was calculated from the date of actual payment, so 75% of the claim was still timely. In these proceedings, the Employer filed a cassation appeal to overturn the Appeal Court's decision, claiming that the Appeal Court had misapplied substantive and procedural norms and had incorrectly interpreted the date from which the limitation period should run, thus constituting judicial error. The Employer alleged the Appeal Court had breached adversarial principles and equality of parties. The Cassation Court found that there were: 1) no procedural or substantive law violations by the Appeal Court; 2) the Appeal Court had correctly applied the statute of limitations and contractual terms; and 3) the Employer had submitted arguments that were based on a misinterpretation of law.

The case concerns an application by the respondent (PVN or the Employer) in an arbitral award (discussed elsewhere in this table) to restrain the appellant (Power Machines or the Contractor) from enforcing previously granted arbitral awards globally, pending the conclusion of Singapore court proceedings to set aside enforcement decisions and the awards themselves. The underlying contract related to a large-scale energy and civil infrastructure project, and the arbitration was seated in Singapore under SIAC Rules.

This ultimately led to a dispute over termination and related costs and damages (discussed elsewhere in this table), which was decided in an arbitral award. This led to a protracted court battle in both the Moscow and Singapore High Courts regarding the enforcement and legitimacy of the awards. PVN argued that enforcement should be restrained because: (1) under Article 36(1)(a)(v) of the UNCITRAL Model Law (and s 31(2)(f) of the International Arbitration Act), the awards were suspended by the supervisory court, giving PVN a contractual right to prevent enforcement globally; (2) enforcement would breach an implied term of the arbitration agreement that Power Machines could not oust the jurisdiction of Singapore courts; (3) enforcement would breach the court’s earlier order of 23 July 2024 prohibiting enforcement “in the meantime” and (4) the ends of justice required an injunction pending appeals, as otherwise PVN’s rights might be rendered nugatory. Power Machines countered that: (1) no suspension order existed - the awards remained binding; (2) the arbitration agreement contained no implied term preventing enforcement abroad; (3) the July 2024 order applied only to enforcement in Singapore, not worldwide; (4) under the New York Convention, foreign enforcement courts have discretion and are not bound by Singapore’s decisions, so PVN’s arguments lacked merit. The court examined local law and Article V(1)(e) of the New York Convention. It held that local law did not give PVN a contractual right to restrain enforcement globally. The July 2024 order only restricted enforcement in Singapore. The court emphasized that enforcement courts abroad retained discretion under the New York Convention and were not obliged to follow Singapore’s decisions. PVN’s arguments on implied terms and ends of justice were found wholly unmeritorious: the High Court dismissed PVN’s application for an anti-enforcement injunction and ordered PVN to pay costs.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-jsc-power-machines-v-vietnam-oil-and-gas-group-and-petrovietnam-technical-service-corporation-judgment-of-the-high-court-of-singapore-2025-sghc-180-monday-8th-september-2025#decision_83386

3,2025,PD Theron and Associates v Namibian Electrical Services (SA 90- 22) [2025] NASC (25 August 2025),Supreme Court of Namibia,1999 (Colour not specified),"The Municipal Council of Windhoek (the Council), the Employer, hired Namibian Electrical Services (NES), the Contractor, for the provision of electrical services in a town in Namibia. After initial disputes, NES secured the contract as a stand-alone agreement requiring adherence to a dispute resolution procedure under clause 20. The original completion date agreed was 10 months from the date of agreement; delays prolonged the works for 18 months. NES blamed the Council for failing to approve drawings; the Council blamed NES. The Council imposed delay damages and deducted them from NES’s payments. NES sought urgent legal assistance to reverse these penalties, employing PD Theron, the claimant, as their legal advisers. NES' original instructions to PD Theron were to commence adjudication under clause 20. However, due to NES falling into financial distress, NES later considered litigation to obtain quicker relief. NES later brought proceedings against PD Theron for professional negligence, claiming that PD Theron had failed to follow the clause 20 dispute mechanism, deviated from their mandate, and lacked appropriate skill and knowledge to advise on law. PD Theron argued that they had simply followed instructions from NES, who had changed their original instructions to instituting action for urgent relief via court-connected mediation. The steps PD Theron had taken aligned with the revised mandate. The court of first instance held PD Theron negligent for not following the clause 20 mechanism, found them to lack the necessary skill and knowledge and that they had failed to follow NES' instructions, and awarded damages to NES. PD Theron appealed against the High Court decision on the basis that the High Court had erred because NES’s instructions changed from following FIDIC procedures to seeking urgent relief through litigation due to financial distress. PD Theron claimed it had complied with this revised mandate by appointing experienced counsel, preparing particulars of claim, and pursuing court-connected mediation. It contended that misunderstanding FIDIC was immaterial, as litigation was the chosen strategy, and no negligence occurred. Finally, PD Theron claimed that NES had failed to prove breach, lack of skill, or damages, relying solely on a lay witness without expert evidence. The Supreme Court upheld the appeal, finding that the relationship between lawyer and client was contractual; a negligence claim required proof of mandate, breach, negligence, damages, and foreseeability. Evidence showed that NES had initially wanted to follow the clause 20 mechanism, but had later instructed urgent action to “break the dispute” due to cash flow problems. PD Theron had acted on revised instructions and taken appropriate action to follow the revised mandate. The Supreme Court also found that there was no expert evidence that proved lack of skill as NES’s expert was a layperson and could not opine on legal standards. Further, the Supreme Court held that any misunderstanding of FIDIC was immaterial because the mandate had shifted. The High Court’s judgment was set aside and NES' claim was dismissed with costs.",Link,https://ejustice.jud.na/Supreme Court/Judgments/Judgments/PD Theron and Associates v Namibian Electrical Services  (SA 90-22) %5b2025%5d NASC (25 August 2025).docx
4,2025,Inyatsi Construction Limited v Absa Bank Uganda Limited and Another (Miscellaneous Application 566 of 2025) [2025] UGHCCD 119 (14 August 2025),High Court of Uganda at Kampala,Not specified,"This was a review application challenging a court order that dismissed an application for an injunction to restrain Absa Bank from paying Advance Payment Guarantees to the Government of Uganda (the Employer, referred to as 'the Government'). The underlying contract was for the construction of an earth dam in Uganda. Inyatsi, the Contractor, terminated the contract due to payment defaults. The Government disputed this and issued its own termination 10 days later. A dispute arose over which termination was lawful. The DAAB ruled in favour of Inyatsi, declaring the Government’s termination null and void. At the commencement of the contract, Inyatsi had secured two advance payment guarantees (APGs) from Absa Bank, one in USD and one in UGX. Upon termination, the Government demanded encashment of both. Absa refused the USD APG, citing its expiry upon certification of over 15% of the contract value. The Government later reissued its demand; Absa upheld its refusal on the USD APG but agreed to pay the UGX APG under Clause 14.2.3, which made it payable upon termination by either party. In the meantime, Inyatsi applied for two injunctions to stop Absa Bank from encashing the APGs. The first was granted but later dismissed; the second was dismissed for lack of evidence of fraud, illegality, or constitutional breach. Inyatsi sought review of the second dismissal, arguing it contained errors on the face of the record, particularly references to fraud and unconscionability, which were not pleaded. Absa Bank opposed the review, arguing it was invalid as the APG demand occurred 6 months after the original ruling. It maintained that unconscionability was not a valid ground, as only fraud, unpled by Inyatsi, could justify blocking payment. Absa also contended the review was procedurally barred under local law due to a prior appeal. The court found that Inyatsi's application was incompetent on three grounds: (1) Inyatsi did not plead fraud, which was the only valid ground to block payment of an APG; (2) the alleged errors Inyatsi was complaining of were more appropriate to be heard under appeal, not review; and (3) review of court decisions could only take place when appeals were no longer possible. As Inyatsi had already previously appealed this decision, the application for review was incompetent and dismissed. The court found Inyatsi had failed to prove grounds for review and ordered Absa Bank to pay the UGX APG to the Government.",Link,https://ulii.org/akn/ug/judgment/ughccd/2025/119/eng@2025-08-14

In SUM 12, Ircon, Mitsui, and Tata, (together, the Contractors) sought permission to file an additional witness statement to raise new grounds opposing the set-aside application. Permission was granted, but costs were ordered in favour of the DFCCI. The DFCCI argued for full recovery of professional fees and disbursements, citing principles from Senda International Capital Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd and Order 22 Rule 3 of the SICC Rules, which emphasize compensating the successful party for reasonably incurred costs. The Contractors countered that costs were disproportionate and referenced local law, suggesting a much lower range. The court rejected reliance on the local law, noting the distinct compensatory basis for SICC costs. For the substantive proceedings, the DFCCI claimed professional fees and disbursements which the Contractors argued these were excessive and unnecessary given the straightforward nature of the application (primarily breach of natural justice). The court scrutinized the hours and team size, finding them excessive, and applied reductions based on proportionality and reasonableness. It also significantly reduced disbursements for Indian lawyers, noting their limited contribution to Singapore law issues. The court concluded by awarding the DFCCI total costs.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-ircon-international-ltd-mitsui-co-ltd-and-tata-projects-ltd-v-dedicated-freight-corridor-corporation-of-india-i-judgment-of-the-singapore-international-commercial-court-2025-sghc-i-20-wednesday-6th-august-2025#decision_82767

The case concerns an insolvency notice arising from a contractual dispute over installation works for pedestrian scanning. Kenya Hospital Association (the Nairobi Hospital), the Employer, sought a stay of insolvency proceedings and referral of the dispute to arbitration under the contract’s arbitration clause. It argued that the debt claimed by Opticom, the Contractor, was disputed due to issues with equipment quality and lack of a valid payment certificate. The Nairobi Hospital contended that proceeding with insolvency would be premature and prejudicial. Opticom opposed the application, asserting that the debt was undisputed and supported by Payment Certificate No. 6. It argued that the Nairobi Hospital failed to invoke the pre-arbitral steps required under Clause 21 of the FIDIC contract, including Engineer’s determination and DAAB decision, and that the mere existence of an arbitration clause did not bar insolvency proceedings under local law. The Court considered local law and the structured dispute resolution process under the Red Book. It held that while the arbitration clause was valid, the Nairobi Hospital had not properly invoked it or demonstrated a genuine dispute. The Court emphasized that dissatisfaction alone, without activating contractual mechanisms, did not constitute a bona fide dispute.

4,2025,Dipcon Engineering Services Ltd v Urban Development Corporation of Trinidad and Tobago Ltd (Trinidad and Tobago) [2025] UKPC 29 (25 June 2025),Privy Council,1987 Red,"This Privy Council appeal concerned a Court of Appeal decision against Dipcon, a contractor engaged by the Urban Development Corporation (the Respondent and Employer, referred to as 'UDeCOTT') for infrastructure works on a housing project in Trinidad and Tobago. After completion, Dipcon sought Additional Payment due to an increase in the cost of materials and labour. After negotiating, UDeCOTT agreed to pay a reduced 'Agreed Sum' but denied liability for the remainder ('the Additional Claim'). Dipcon sought payment of the Additional Claim in the High Court under Clause 70.1, which found that UDeCOTT was not liable to pay the Additional Claim because: the Agreed Sum was not final regarding additional costs; UDeCOTT re-assessed the Additional Claim but did not obtain board approval; and no binding agreement to pay the Additional Claim could exist without board approval. Dipcon appealed this decision in the Court of Appeal, changing their reliance on Clause 70.1 and claiming that Clause 53.4 superseded Clause 70.1. Dipcon argued that the Additional Claim was valid under the price adjustment clause (Clause 70.1) due to inflation and cost increases and that the parties were bound by price adjustment mechanisms outlined in Part II of the contract, the 'Conditions of Particular Application' ('PC'). Dipcon also argued that UDeCOTT’s reassessment and internal communications formed a binding agreement to pay, even without board approval. Dipcon relied on Clause 53.4 as a fallback, asserting the Engineer’s assessment and UDeCOTT’s conduct had validated the claim despite procedural gaps. Dipcon further invoked estoppel or legitimate expectation, contending that UDeCOTT’s actions reasonably led Dipcon to expect payment, making denial based on internal processes unfair. The Court of Appeal rejected Dipcon, finding that the High Court Judge was correct: board approval was a consistent and necessary condition for payment; the reassessment did not amount to a binding agreement; and Clause 53.4 still required formal verification, which had not been completed. Dipcon appealed to the Privy Council, maintaining that Clause 70.1 still applied, though it acknowledged that the PC lacked the mechanism to determine price adjustment. Dipcon accepted their non-compliance with Clauses 53.1 and 53.2, but explicitly relied solely on Clause 53.4 to validate the claim, arguing that board approval was not required to create a binding agreement and that Clause 53.4 allowed the Engineer to assess the claim even if earlier steps were missed. Dipcon emphasized that the claim was settled after project completion, suggesting that procedural clauses were less applicable. The Privy Council rejected Dipcon's reliance on Clause 53.4, stating that it failed without valid verification by UDeCoTT Board, which had not been obtained. The Privy Council found there was no binding agreement or estoppel, as Dipcon itself had acknowledged the need for board approval, and therefore dismissed the appeal.",Link,https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2025/29.html
5,2025,Bank of Tanzania vs Galilea Company Limited (Commercial Case No. 000030499 of 2024) [2025] TZHCComD 137 (20 June 2025),"High Court of Tanzania, Commercial Division",Not specified,"This was a challenge to an arbitral award in the Tanzania High Court, centring on a contract for the installation of a fire suppression system. Galilea Company Ltd, the Contractor, sought adjudication in the Tanzania Institute of Arbitrators for EOT, site-handover, and payment, which was decided in favour of Galilea. The Bank of Tanzania (the Employer) was dissatisfied with the adjudication decision and sought arbitration, the outcome of which was also in favour of Galilea. In the current proceedings, the Bank challenged the arbitral award on grounds that the award lacked substantive jurisdiction and contained serious irregularities in law. The Bank challenged the award on 6 grounds alleging as follows: (1) Procedural irregularity: the Arbitrator failed to provide records which were required under law; (2) Lack of jurisdiction: the Arbitrator determined the dispute based on the principles governing a FIDIC contract, which the parties had not agreed to be bound by; (3) Breach of public policy due to procedural irregularity: Galilea did not provide a witness statement to support their case, which was a procedural irregularity: awarding damages in favour of Galilea in the face of a lack of evidence was contrary to public policy; (4) Exceeded scope: the Arbitrator treated the arbitration like an appeal instead of deciding based on the parties' evidence by confirming the adjudicator's decision: this constituted acting outside the terms of reference; (5) Bias: the Arbitrator unfairly decided in favour of Galilea and against the Bank in matters that were patently in breach of the contract; (6) Breach of public policy: the Arbitrator acted against public policy by ignoring Galilea's breach of contract, which was governed by Tanzanian law. The court set aside the award, finding in favour of the Bank on 2 grounds (Grounds 1 and 3) and dismissing the remaining 4 grounds (Grounds 2, 4, 5, and 6): (1) Procedural irregularities confirmed: the missing records violated the law, constituting serious irregularities; (2) Jurisdiction confirmed: the Arbitrator's reference to the FIDIC contract was purely interpretative, and was not used to determine the substantive matters in contention, therefore the Arbitrator did not exceed their jurisdiction; (3) Breach of public policy due to procedural irregularity: Galilea failed to submit a witness statement or evidence to support their pleadings, and the Arbitrator's sole reliance on Galilea's pleadings amounted to misconduct, a 'serious irregularity', and was 'procedurally flawed and unjust'; (4) Scope was not exceeded: the Arbitrator did not confirm, vary, comment on or say anything in respect of the adjudicator’s decision, meaning the Bank's claim that the Arbitrator exceeded their scope was unfounded; (5) Bias unproven: the Arbitrator was not required to balance the interests of both parties in his decision, and as his decision was based on merit, the claim that the Arbitrator was biased was unfounded; and (6) Public policy misconstrued: the Bank had 'misconceived' Tanzanian law when challenging on this ground as there was no instance of fraud or illegal practice.",Link,https://tanzlii.org/akn/tz/judgment/tzhccomd/2025/137/eng@2025-06-20

The Guidelines required consulting engineers on government projects to provide performance guarantees and professional liability insurance. The Uganda Association of Consulting Engineers sought a declaration that these Guidelines were 'illegal, irrational, in bad faith, unreasonable and in breach of the rules of natural justice' and an order quashing the specific directive requiring engineers to provide performance guarantees. The Association argued that these Guidelines were contrary to FIDIC guidelines and the PPDA Act, and were an act of bad faith, as the PPDA Authority did not give the Association an opportunity to be heard. The PPDA authority counterargued that the application should be rejected as: the PPDA Act did not mandate taking opinions when undertaking any of its functions; FIDIC guidelines were not binding but persuasive only; it had a mandate to issue the Guidelines; and that the application lacked merit and was defective. The court found that: FIDIC guidelines were not binding but persuasive only; the Guidelines were in line with the PPDA Act; the requirement for Performance Guarantees were reasonable and not irrational; and finally, the Guidelines were advisory and non-binding and therefore not suitable for judicial review. Additionally, the court noted that FIDIC had set professional liability insurance and Performance Guarantees as a globally accepted standard for security, so the Association's arguments lacked merit.

The summaries of these 3 decisions have been summarised in 1 entry for the sake of brevity. The language of these cases are Russian. In summary, Power Machines, a Russian company, and PetroVietnam Technical Service Corporation (PTSC), a Vietnamese company, together made up a Consortium of Contractors and entered into a contract with Vietnam Oil & Gas Group (PVN, aka the Employer) in 2014 for the construction of a power plant in Vietnam (the Project), which commenced in 2015. The imposition of US sanctions on Russian companies in 2014, which included Power Machines, led to Power Machines' subcontractors being affected and suspending their work on the Project in 2018. This ultimately led to a dispute over termination and related costs and damages (discussed elsewhere in this table), which was decided in an arbitral award. This led to a protracted court battle in both the Moscow and Singapore High Courts regarding the enforcement and legitimacy of the awards. Case 1: 05 June 2025 Power Machines sought recognition and enforcement of SIAC Award No. 144 (dated 30 November 2023, amended 11 January 2024) in Russia and challenged a ruling refusing to involve third parties in the enforcement proceedings. PVN argued that the refusal could be appealed to the appellate court; Power Machines countered that such rulings are only subject to cassation review under Article 240(5) of the Arbitration Procedure Code. The court examined procedural rules and local law, emphasizing that appeals against writ issuance rulings should bypass appellate review and go directly to cassation. The court dismissed the cassation appeal and upheld the appellate ruling, confirming that the refusal to involve third parties cannot be appealed in the appellate procedure. Case 2: 16 June 2025 PVN applied to clarify the court’s 5 June 2025 decision, claiming ambiguity regarding why the court rejected arguments about involving third parties and the appealability of such refusals. PVN argued that the reasoning lacked detail; Power Machines opposed, citing local law which allows clarification only without altering content. The court reviewed constitutional and Supreme Court precedents, stressing that clarification cannot change reasoning or add new explanations. The court denied the application for clarification, finding the prior decision clear and unambiguous. Case 3: 08 September 2025 PVN challenged the 16 June 2025 ruling that denied clarification of the 5 June 2025 cassation decision. PVN argued that the decision lacked clarity on why courts rejected arguments about involving third parties. Power Machines opposed, asserting the decision was clear. The court analysed local law, noting that clarification applies only when ambiguity impedes execution, which was absent. The court emphasized that disagreement with reasoning does not justify clarification or annulment. The court upheld the 16 June 2025 ruling and dismissed the complaint, confirming no grounds for clarification or reversal.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-jsc-power-machines-v-vietnam-oil-and-gas-group-and-petrovietnam-technical-service-corporation-decision-of-the-moscow-commercial-court-a40-20468-2024-thursday-5th-june-2025#decision_83934

The court of first instance's decision is discussed elsewhere in this table. The language of this case is Russian. The court of first instance dismissed the Contractor’s claim for late payment (by four years from the due date) due to expiry of the three-year statutory limitation period. The Contractor was not able to rebut the argument on statutory limitation in the court of first instance, and so appealed to the Ninth Arbitration Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal found that each day of delay constituted a separate obligation, with its own three-year limitation period. Therefore, the limitation period for the recovery of penalty for delayed payment for the first year had expired, but the remaining 3 years were still within the limitation period and should be payable. The court also found that Clause 6.3 of the Contract capped liability at 1% of the contract value, so the calculated penalty was reduced from 99m rubles to 6.9m rubles. The Court of Appeal overturned the court of first instance's decision and ordered the Employer to pay the reduced penalty fee.",Link,https://ras.arbitr.ru/Kad/PdfDocument/df1cf9e6-f4c7-413c-86eb-374bfded954b/69209078-baa9-426d-a896-0e16f5f7823e/%D0%9040-208566-2024__20250522.pdf
6,2025,IRCON International Ltd.; Mitsui & Co.; Ltd. and Tata Projects Ltd. v. Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (I); Judgment of the Singapore International Commercial Court [2025] SGHC(I) 15 - 5 May 2025,High Court of Singapore (International Commercial Division),1999 Yellow,"This is a judgment in the Singapore International Commercial Court. The case concerns an application to set aside an ICC arbitral award seated in Singapore arising from a Yellow Book Contract (the CTP-11 Contract) for works on India’s Dedicated Freight Corridor project. This case ran parallel to IRCON International Ltd., Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Tata Projects Ltd. v. Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (II), ICC Case No. 26733/HTG, which is discussed elsewhere in this table and addresses the same arbitral award. The Singapore-seated arbitration ran simultaneously alongside two Indian arbitrations (CP-301 and CP-302) concerning similar wage rate notifications. Judge C presided over all three. After publication of the award, it became evident that the tribunal had used the CP-301 award as a template, drawing heavily on insights from the parallel proceedings when drafting the Singapore award. In this case, the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCI), the Employer, argued that the arbitral award should be set aside because the majority of the tribunal had failed to apply their minds to the evidence and arguments, instead copying extensively from prior related awards, amounting to apparent bias and breach of natural justice. Grounds invoked included: (1) breach of natural justice (s 24(b) IAA; Art 34(2)(a)(ii) Model Law); (2) inability to present its case; (3) adoption of a procedure not in accordance with the parties’ agreement; and (4) conflict with Singapore public policy. Ircon, Mitsui, and Tata (together, the Contractors) counterargued that the tribunal had considered all essential issues and that the DFCCI was attempting an impermissible appeal on the merits. The Contractors also argued preclusion/waiver because the DFCCI had not challenged the tribunal earlier. The Court examined whether the tribunal’s reasoning showed prejudgment. It found extensive reproduction of reasoning and authorities from prior awards, reliance on incorrect contractual provisions, and decisions on interest and costs under Indian law despite the Singapore seat. These demonstrated that the majority approached the issues with a closed mind, infringing the rules of natural justice and the fair hearing principle. The court held that this breach was not merely technical and prejudiced the claimant’s rights. Other grounds were unnecessary to decide, though briefly considered. The award was set aside on the first for breach of natural justice by apparent bias and failure to give a fair hearing.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-ircon-international-ltd-mitsui-co-ltd-and-tata-projects-ltd-v-dedicated-freight-corridor-corporation-of-india-i-judgment-of-the-singapore-international-commercial-court-2025-sghc-i-15-monday-5th-may-2025

DJO, ICC Case No. 26733/HTG, [2024] SGHC(I) 24, 15 August 2024. The original dispute arose from a contract related to India's Dedicated Freight Corridors. IRCON International Ltd., Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Tata Projects Ltd, referred to in the arbitration and court case as DJP, DJQ, and DJR (together, the Contractor Consortium) claimed additional payment due to an increase in minimum wages. The tribunal ruled in favour of the Contractor Consortium, finding the wage increase constituted a change in legislation warranting additional payment. The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India, referred to in the arbitration and court case as DJO (the Employer) appealed, arguing that the tribunal's decision was biased and breached natural justice by copying substantial portions from related arbitration awards. The court set aside the arbitration award due to breaches of natural justice, including extensive copying from parallel proceedings and failure to properly consider unique issues specific to the case. Out of the 451 paragraphs in the Award, it was undisputed that at least 212 paragraphs were copied and pasted from the Parallel Awards. In this appeal, the Contractor Consortium argued that the award should not have been set aside, as the Tribunal's reference to the Parallel Awards had no material impact on the outcome of the Arbitration, and that procedural fairness was therefore not compromised in any meaningful way. The Court of Appeal found that the tribunal's extensive copying from related awards without proper consideration of the specific case did in fact constitute a breach of natural justice on the following grounds: 1. The tribunal relied heavily on submissions and authorities from the earlier arbitrations, which were not part of the current arbitration's submissions. 2. By copying and pasting from the CP-301 award, the tribunal failed to address the unique issues and specific facts of the current arbitration. 3. The tribunal's approach deprived the parties of their right to a fair, independent, and impartial award. 4. The tribunal applied provisions and reasoning from the CP-301 contract that were not relevant to the current arbitration's contract. 5. The tribunal used the wrong lex arbitri for assessing interest and costs. The Court of Appeal found that these actions collectively undermined the integrity of the arbitration process and the parties' right to a fair hearing. The Court of Appeal set aside the award in its entirety due to the compromised integrity of the arbitration process.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-djp-djq-and-djr-v-djo-judgment-of-the-court-of-appeal-of-singapore-2025-sgca-i-2-tuesday-8th-april-2025

The underlying contract involved civil works, including laying pipelines both underground and overground and installing equipment, with provision for payment in Indian Rupees and Japanese Yen. The dispute arose from post-contractual changes in pipeline alignment, which significantly increased the length of pipeline laid underground and the depth of excavation. Spml Infra Limited, the Respondent and Contractor, lodged 16 claims, including for interest, while the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (the Chennai Board), the Appellant and Employer, counterclaimed for delay and liquidated damages. The arbitral tribunal considered whether these changes entitled the Contractor to additional payment under Clause 1.04 and Clause 28, despite provisions like Clause 8.1 and Clause 20 requiring the contractor to inspect the site and assume risks. The tribunal also examined whether the works constituted “extra work” and relied on precedents under local law. The tribunal found in favour of the Contractor, and rejected the Chennai Board's claims for liquidated damages. The Chennai Board challenged the award, alleging the tribunal had: misinterpreted Clauses 1.04 and 28; failed to correctly consider the Contractor's assumption of risk under Clauses 8.1 and 20; exceeded its jurisdiction in granting payments beyond the contract; and made perverse findings unsupported by evidence. The Contractor opposed the appeal, arguing that the tribunal had correctly interpreted the contract clauses and acted within its jurisdiction, and emphasising that the additional works were beyond the original scope, justifying extra payment, and that the award was reasoned and supported by evidence. The Court held that the arbitrators’ findings were neither arbitrary nor perverse and confirmed that additional works justified enhanced payment, and therefore Clauses 8.1 and 20 did not bar claims for additional works. The Court further found that the tribunal had acted within its jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal.",Link,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/134949800/

The contract underpinning this dispute was an EPC contract for the construction of a hydropower plant in Kenya. KTDA (the Employer) complained that Jiangxi (the Contractor) had unilaterally initiated the appointment of a DAB without mutual agreement, violating Clause 20.2 of the contract. In their application, KTDA challenged the appointment of the sole Adjudicator, claiming the process was irregular and did not follow contractual procedures. Jiangxi argued that the appointment was proper and in line with the contract, citing KTDA's failure to propose DAB members. Jiangxi's position was that in line with Clause 20.3 of the contract, KTDA's failure to respond to Jiangxi's Notice of Claim (following Clause 20.1's requirements) meant that Jiangxi could invoke Clause 20.3 and request the body nominated in the contract (in this case CIArb) to appoint an adjudicator. The High Court found that the appointment process was irregular and did not follow the agreed contractual procedures, as the contract required both parties to agree on the appointment of the DAB members. The court also considered that there was no evidence of negotiations between the parties on the appointment of a DAB. The court decided that Jiangxi's unilateral action violated these procedures, and that Jiangxi's argument (that the appointment was proper because KTDA had failed to propose DAB members) did not justify bypassing the agreed process.

7,2025,M/S Hodi (Hotel Management) Company Limited vs M/S Jandu Plumber Limited (Civil Appeal No. 396 of 2022) [2025] TZCA 138 (28 February 2025),Court of Appeal of Tanzania,1999 (Colour not specified),"This is an appeal against a High Court judgment dismissing an arbitral award and calling for re-arbitration. The High Court judgement is listed below (Jandu v Hodi). Key points of this appeal were whether the arbitrator had jurisdiction over the case, and whether it was correct for the High Court to set aside the award and order re-arbitration. The underlying contract was for the rehabilitation and upgrade of wet works in a hotel. Jandu, the Contractor, had conducted preliminary work in accordance with the contract but could not proceed with the actual works without funds and drawings from Hodi, the Employer. According to Jandu, Hodi failed to provide funds or drawings in accordance with the contract, and as a result, Jandu terminated and sued Hodi for breach of contract. The suit was stayed pending arbitration. Jandu then initiated arbitration against Hodi, to which Hodi counter-claimed. The arbitrator found for Hodi, after which Jandu appealed to the court to set aside the award. The High Court found for Jandu and ordered re-arbitration. In its appeal, Hodi argued that the judge had made errors in dismissing the arbitral award and ordering re-arbitration, namely that Clause 20.2 of the contract mandated that if, in case of a dispute, the parties fail to reach a settlement, the matter should be referred to a mediator, who must provide a written opinion within 28 days. This opinion was crucial as it was binding unless disputed within 14 days, and if the dispute was referred to arbitration, the arbitrator's jurisdiction was contingent upon receiving a proper opinion from the mediator. The mediator had provided a report stating, ""Mediation has failed,"" but did not include any detailed reasoning or explanation. Hodi argued that this report was deemed insufficient as it lacked the necessary elements of an opinion, such as views, advice, or judgment. Hodi argued that the absence of a detailed written opinion meant that the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the arbitration. The Court of Appeal considered that the arbitrator had, in fact, lacked jurisdiction, as the mediator did not provide a proper written opinion, and that the High Court judgment was correct. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.",Link,https://tanzlii.org/akn/tz/judgment/tzca/2025/138/eng@2025-02-28
7,2025,Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago v Waterworks Ltd (Trinidad and Tobago) [2025] UKPC 9 (18 February 2025),UK Privy Council,1999 Yellow,"This is a Privy Council decision in relation to a dispute centring on two contracts for the design and build of water treatment plants at different locations in Trinidad and Tobago ('the main contracts'). The parties to the contracts were the Water and Sewerage Authority (the Employer) and Waterworks (the Contractor). At the time of tender, Waterworks had entered into preliminary agreements with MAAK, a third party supplier, to purchase equipment to carry out works for the project under the main contracts. The Employer first informed the Contractor of various delays to the completion of the designs of the project and in the commencement of the project's construction. The Employer then later terminated both main contracts for ""convenience"" before finalising the designs or beginning the works. As a result, the Contractor had to cancel the agreements with its supplier (before performance of those agrements even started), leading to cancellation charges of 30% of the quoted price. The Contractor attempted to invoice the Employer for the supplier's cancellation charges by requesting an Engineer's determination; in the determination, the Engineer rejected payment of these charges. The Contractor brought proceedings against the Employer in the High Court for sums including the cancellation charges. The High Court found in favour of the Contractor on the grounds that they were costs reasonably incurred in the expectation of completing the works. The Employer appealed to the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago, which overturned the High Court decision on four grounds: firstly, it was premature and therefore unreasonable for the Contractor to commit to liabilities for cancellation charges at such an early stage, before final designs were approved; secondly, it was not reasonable for the Contractor to agree to a cancellation charge of 30% of the quoted price; thirdly, the supplier agreements were not for the actual supply of equipment; and finally, the preliminary designs were not sufficiently detailed to identify the equipment needed for construction, and therefore entering into equipment purchases was premature. The Contractor appealed the Court of Appeal's decision on grounds that they had in fact acted reasonably in entering into the supplier agreements, particularly considering the initially brief period of time allocated for contract performance. The Privy Council unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal's decision, ruling that the cancellation charges did not fall within the scope of reasonable costs under the FIDIC contract, and further, that the Contractor's decision to enter into a 'bad bargain' was not justification for the Employer to bear the charges. The Privy Council also noted (a) the absence of evidence explaining why the Contractor entered into the supplier agreements, (b) why it was thought to be in the Contractor's interests at the time, and (c) the failure of the High Court judge to consider the reasonableness of agreeing to 30% cancellation charges.",Link,https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKPC/2025/9.html&query=(fidic)
7,2025,Kwale International Sugar Company Limited v Epco Builders Limited & 2 others (Civil Appeal 208 of 2020) [2025] KECA 227 (KLR) (7 February 2025) (Judgment),"Court of Appeal at Nairobi, Kenya",Not specified,"This is an appeal of a High Court ruling in relation to an underlying contract for the construction of a sugar factory. Epco (the Contractor) sought payment for works completed. Kwale (the Employer) acknowledged that they owed Epco outstanding fees, but did not agree on the amount owed and did not pay the full amount sought by Epco. Epco entered a creditor's petition due to lack of payment, thereby initiating insolvency proceedings on behalf of Kwale. Kwale filed an application challenging the validity of the insolvency proceedings and seeking the orders that Epco's creditor's petition be set aside and a declaration that the insolvency petition was null and void and should be struck out, on grounds that: the parties' original contract required dispute resolution through mutual consultation and arbitration; mutual consultation had failed; arbitration had not yet been concluded; and Epco had issued a premature statutory demand, leading to malicious insolvency proceedings intended to harm the appellant's business. However, Epco opposed the application and filed an objection on grounds of: the process of assessment, evaluation, and certification of works under the contract; Kwale's payment delays; other creditors' support of the petition; and that Kwale's application had misapplied the Insolvency Regulations. The High Court rejected Kwale's application to halt the insolvency proceedings, and thus Kwale appealed. In their appeal, Kwale argued that the judge had erred on several grounds, namely (a) in deciding that the High Court had jurisdiction when the arbitration clause had not been exhausted and (b) in not considering the insolvency petition to be premature, as the arbitrator had not yet determined the Employer's indebtedness or existence of such debt. Kwale also argued that: the alleged debt was disputed; that Epco's claim for IPCs was invalid; and that according to the contract, the engineer was required to verify works before any payment could be made. Epco argued that the invoices were not and had never been disputed and that the circumstances for the court to interfere with the previous court's decision did not arise as there was no bona fide dispute regarding debt. Epco asserted that: the debt definitely existed, as proven by the certified IPCs; unless an IPC was disputed, payment could not be resisted; and Kwale had made part payments in the past, which served as sufficient acknowledgement of the debt. The Court of Appeal decided that the High Court's rejection of Kwale's application was correct. The appeal failed and was dismissed on the grounds that: (a) the High Court had jurisdiction to entertain Epco's creditor's petition despite the arbitration clause in the contract; (b) the existence of the debt was not disputed as Kwale had admitted owing the debt but disputed the amount; and (c) the appeal was incorrectly drafted from provisions applicable to personal bankruptcy, not corporate liquidation. The Court of Appeal directed that the creditor's petition proceed for hearing before a different judge and should be heard on its merits. However, the Court of Appeal did acknowledge the High Court judge had erred in attempting to draw conclusions on issues which had yet to be tried or had not been considered: for example, on whether there was a dispute as to the existence of the debt, which Kwale had already admitted.",Link,https://new.kenyalaw.org/akn/ke/judgment/keca/2025/227/eng@2025-02-07
8,2025,"M/S.Chennai Metro Rail vs Transtonnelstroy Limited on 31 January, 2025","High Court at Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",Yellow (Year not specified),"This is an application to set aside two arbitration awards. The dispute in the arbitration awards centred on contractor claims for additional costs due to changes in minimum wages, relating to a contract for the design and construction of underground stations and tunnels in Chennai (also known as Madras). Chennai Metro Rail (the Employer) applied to set aside the awards on grounds that the Tribunal's interpretation of the contract was patently illegal and contrary to public policy. Additionally, they argued that Transtonnelstroy (the Contractor) did not properly notify them within the required timeframe for claiming additional costs due to changes in minimum wages. The court concluded that the Tribunal's award was patently illegal and contrary to public policy on the following grounds: - the Tribunal had misread and misapplied the relevant contract clauses (13.16.2 to 13.16.5), particularly failing to harmonize them with the modifications introduced by government regulations. - the Tribunal's interpretation allowed for additional costs due to changes in law, despite the contract explicitly preventing such claims if the price variation formula (CPA 32) was already adopted, except for specific exceptions (e.g. customs duties and excise duties). - the Tribunal also ignored essential terms of the contract, leading to an interpretation that effectively rewrote the contract, which was not permissible. - Transtonnelstroy did not adequately plead or prove that the change in law (minimum wage increase) impacted their performance, which was a necessary condition for claiming additional costs under the contract. The court also considered that the amendment to minimum wages was introduced on 18 June 2014, with effect from 16 July 2014. Transtonnelstroy was required to notify the Employer within 28 days of this change. Transtonnelstroy notified the Employer on 19 September 2014, which was beyond the 28-day period stipulated in the contract. Clause 20.1 of the contract required timely notification for any additional payment claims. Failure to comply with this clause meant that Transtonnelstroy was not entitled to the additional payment. These factors led the court to conclude that Transtonnelstroy's claim for additional costs was invalid due to the late notification. The court therefore found in favour of the Employer and set aside the awards.",Link,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/158274617/

The underlying dispute arose from a subcontract agreement for construction works (including cladding, paving, and flooring works) on a project for the construction of the Chancery & Staff Residences for the High Commission of India in Mauritius. Laxmanbhai, the Contractor, argued that the arbitral award should be set aside because (i) the Arbitrator had decided issues beyond its scope of submission to arbitration, and (ii) breaches of natural justice occurred. Laxmanbhai also contended that Minaco, the sub-contractor, had failed to comply with mandatory pre-arbitration steps under Sub-Clauses 20.4–20.6 and that the Arbitrator had improperly introduced arguments not advanced by either party. Laxmanbhai also challenged a mandatory order regarding the delivery of remaining materials as exceeding jurisdiction. Minaco countered that: the Arbitrator had acted within his mandate; the ruling on admissibility constituted a partial award; and Laxmanbhai should have challenged it within three months in line with local law, and therefore was out of time. Minaco maintained there was no common ground on the interpretation of “Engineer” between the parties and that the Arbitrator’s reasoning had preserved fairness and contractual intent. The Court examined whether the Arbitrator’s ruling on admissibility was a partial award, whether natural justice was breached, and whether the Arbitrator exceeded jurisdiction in ordering delivery of remaining materials. It held that the ruling was a partial award, that Laxmanbhai had full opportunity to address issues, and that the mandatory order was linked to damages and therefore fell within the Arbitrator’s discretion under the Terms of Reference. The Court emphasized the high threshold for setting aside awards and the principle of finality under local law. The Supreme Court dismissed Laxmanbhai’s application and upheld the arbitral award and its correction, finding no breach of natural justice or excess of jurisdiction. The application was set aside with costs.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-minaco-pty-ltd-v-laxmanbhai-co-judgement-of-the-supreme-court-of-mauritius-2025-scj-21-friday-17th-january-2025#decision_84137

The Moscow Arbitration Court reviewed the appeal but found no grounds to overturn the original decision, maintaining the enforcement of the award.

The arbitrations related to a joint venture agreement entered into with a Macedonian company ""G"" for the construction of a section of a Polish motorway. G refused to comply with the arbitral awards and had no substantial assets abroad. The Macedonian courts refused to enforce the arbitral awards in violation of the 1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. NDI filed a complaint in the ECHR under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (Right to a fair trial). NDI's grounds were that the Macedonian courts had given insufficient reasons for their decisions to refuse recognition, had not conducted a proper examination of the submissions and evidence presented by the parties, and the courts’ reasoning underlying both grounds for the refusal of recognition had been manifestly flawed. The ECHR declared the complaint under Article 6 of the Convention admissible and held that there was a violation of Article 6. The ECHR found that the Macedonian courts failed to comply with statutory law as they failed to respond to NDI's specific and important arguments in their decision, and also that the courts had failed to give an adequate response to NDI's specific arguments which could have been decisive for the outcome of the proceedings. As a result, the courts’ reasoning was not sufficient, as the courts did not attach sufficient weight to important aspects of the case.

8,2024,Estate Management and Business Development Company Ltd v Junior Sammy Contractors Ltd (Trinidad and Tobago) [2024] UKPC 33 (29 October 2024),Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; Appeal from the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago,1999 Red,"Decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upholding a decision of the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago. The judge at first instance, upheld by the Court of Appeal, granted Junior Sammy summary judgment on seven unpaid interim certificates relating to infrastructure works for a major housing development in Trinidad. Estate Management argued before the Privy Council that judgment should be set aside because there was reason to believe that the certificates had been obtained fraudulently and, in any event, Junior Sammy had no right to bring the claim because there had been an absolute assignment of the debt to their bank. The Privy Council dismissed the allegations of fraud as being of no substance and gave guidance on the legal principles of the law of assignment and the distinction between an absolute legal assignment and an assignment by way of charge only. On the assignment point, the essential question was whether the bank had granted a loan secured by a charge on the debt or instead had acquired the debt owed by employer to Junior Sammy. The Board reviewed the authorities on the distinction between legal and equitable assignments and approached the matter considering all the relevant instruments. There were indicators within the terms of the instruments which supported different conclusions. A key factor that suggested a loan was a factoring agreement, which provided that Junior Sammy retained the right to bring proceedings against the employer. This was an indicator (with others) that the assignment was to take effect by way of charge only. Accordingly, it was not necessary for the Privy Council to determine whether a failure to assign the right to sue on its own entailed that the assignment was not absolute. The Privy Council therefore expressed no concluded view on that question, save to say that the failure to assign the right to sue to the assignee is at least a 'very strong indicator' that the assignment is not absolute. Further, when the question does arise for decision, the Privy Council stated that much may be said in favour of the view that it does entail that the assignment was by way of charge only.",Link,https://jcpc.uk/cases/judgments/jcpc-2023-0031

The context of this appeal is as follows: on 30 November 2023, the Tribunal handed down a Final Award in SIAC (exhibited elsewhere in this table). After the Final Award was issued, largely in favour of Power Machines (main member of the Contractor Consortium with PetroVietnam Technical Service Corporation or PTSC), Power Machines applied to the High Court of Singapore for leave to enforce the Final Award, which was granted (unreported). Thereafter, Vietnam Oil & Gas Group (PVN, aka the Employer) applied to the High Court to set aside the order to enforce the Final Award, and to set aside two findings in the Final Award (one on liability and the other on damages). The High Court judge found that there was a breach of the rules of natural justice with respect to the finding on liability, but declined to set aside the finding on damages; ultimately, the judge remitted the matter to the Tribunal and stayed enforcement of the Final Award in the interim. This decision was unreported. Thereafter, PVN applied to set aside the judge's decision to remit the matter to the Tribunal. They applied on the following grounds: that the Tribunal's award involved a breach of the rules of natural justice, which affected the fairness of the proceedings; that the Second Notice of Termination should have superseded the First Notice of Termination, and this issue needed to be reconsidered; and that the Tribunal's conclusions were flawed and required reassessment. Meanwhile, Power Machines appealed against the whole of the judge's decision on the finding of liability on the following grounds: that the Tribunal's decision did not breach the rules of natural justice; that the Tribunal's reasoning in finding that the Second Notice of Termination superseded the First Notice of Termination was valid and within the scope of the arbitration; that the Tribunal provided a fair hearing and that the parties had reasonable notice of the Tribunal's potential reasoning; that the Tribunal's findings were within the scope of the arbitration agreement and did not exceed its jurisdiction; and that it was unnecessary to remit the matter to the Tribunal and that the Tribunal's original findings should stand. The High Court judge held as follows: In response to PVN's application, the judge upheld his original decision to remit the matter to the Tribunal, finding that the Tribunal's reasoning breached natural justice by departing from both parties' cases, and addressed issues beyond the arbitration scope. In response to Power Machines' application, the judge rejected their appeal. In respect of liability, the judge found that the liability issues (i.e. the validity of both Notices of Termination and whether the Second superseded the First) were not appropriately considered by the Tribunal. In respect of damages, the judge concluded that Power Machines' claims for damages were the same whether the EPC Contract was terminated under the First or the Second Notice of Termination, and therefore no material difference would be made to the outcome of the Final Award; however, in order to uphold procedural fairness, the award would still be remitted so that the Tribunal would resolve the issue on liability. The judge further confirmed that Power Machines was prohibited from enforcing the Award until the Tribunal had issued their decision.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-jsc-power-machines-v-vietnam-oil-and-gas-group-petrovietnam-and-petrovietnam-technical-service-corporation-grounds-of-decision-of-the-high-court-of-singapore-2024-sghc-244-tuesday-24th-september-2024#decision_68424

The Centralny Port Komunikacyjny (the Employer), published a procurement notice for the project, in line with statutory law. However, following actions and omissions by the Employer in the procurement process, two contractors, Strabag and Porr (together, 'the Contractors') filed separate appeals objecting to several provisions of the procurement documentation and the draft agreement. These appeals were combined for joint consideration by the National Appeal Chamber. Strabag appealed on the grounds that: - the Employer had violated various provisions of the Civil Code and Public Procurement Law by introducing restrictive and unfair terms in the contract, such as the limitation of indirect costs to those incurred exclusively in Poland, and the requirement to attach source documents to cost calculations. - the Employer had incorrectly interpreted and applied EU sanctions regulations, particularly the 10% threshold for services provided by entities covered by sanctions. Strabag argued that the threshold should apply individually to each entity rather than collectively. - the Employer's right to unilaterally change the template of the declaration in unspecified ""justified"" situations was unfair and applied incorrectly. Porr appealed on the grounds that: - various provisions of the draft agreement, including those related to remuneration, indexation, and the acceptance of works, were unclear, imprecise, and grossly unfavourable to contractors. - there were concerns about the suspension of performance and the coverage of costs during such periods. Porr requested amendments to the contract to ensure that the contractor's costs during suspension periods are covered from the first day of suspension. - the possibility of limiting the scope of the order without specifying the minimum size or value was unfair and Porr requested that the ordering party specify the minimum size or value of the parties' performance. - the criteria for accepting performance security in the form of a bank or insurance guarantee were too restrictive and should be amended to allow more flexibility. The Chamber partially upheld the appeals, ordering amendments to certain contract provisions to ensure compliance with legal standards. Notably, the Chamber ruled that the 10% threshold for services provided by entities covered by sanctions should apply individually to each entity, rather than collectively. The Chamber also addressed issues related to the suspension of performance and the scope of the order, ensuring that the Contractors' costs during suspension periods were covered and specifying the minimum size or value of the parties' performance. The Chamber's findings emphasized the importance of fair competition, equal treatment of contractors, and transparency in public procurement processes.

The arbitration was seated in Singapore (the ""Arbitration"") which ran in parallel with two other arbitrations, seated in India - the CP-301 and CP-302 arbitrations. The subject matter of these three proceedings were broadly similar, insofar as it related to a similar notification about an increase in daily rates for minimum wages payable by the Indian Ministry of Labour. Each of the three proceedings had a three-member arbitral tribunal, and the presiding arbitrator (Judge C) of the Arbitration was the presiding arbitrator in all three arbitrations, and therefore fully aware of and immersed in the underlying facts and issues in the two parallel proceedings whilst presiding over the Arbitration. The tribunal elected to use the CP-301 award as a template for the award in the Arbitration. It was evident to the parties that Judge C drew heavily upon and applied his knowledge acquired from the parallel proceedings to the writing of the award of the Arbitration. DJO highlighted the following: (1) the tribunal placed weight on submissions in the earlier arbitrations and did not restrict itself to the submissions made in the Arbitration; (2) drew upon authorities not cited in the earlier arbitrations which were not cited in the Arbitration; (3) recited and relied upon provisions in the CP-301 contract that were not found in the CPT-13 contract; (4) applied the wrong lex arbitri to the assessment of interest and costs; and (5) failed to properly consider the appropriate and certain unique issues to the Arbitration. The main issue for DJO was the scale, scope and source of the cut-and-pasting. The applicant asserted four breaches of natural justice in the making of the award – (1) impermissible pre-judging of the case; (2) the copious copy-and-pasting deprived it of its right to a fair, independent and impartial award; (3) breached its right to a fair hearing which requires a tribunal to deal with the dispute before it; and (4) by lifting the reasoning of the parallel proceedings, the tribunal breach the right to a fair hearing which prevents a tribunal form relying on factual or legal reasoning that has not been canvassed before it without giving the parties the opportunity to respond thereto. Consortium X reasoned that the real issue was whether or not the tribunal applied its mind to the essential issues in the Arbitration, and asserted that the tribunal did do so. The Court concluded that the Award was made in breach of natural justice and was therefore liable to be set aside on that ground.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-djp-djq-and-djr-v-djo-judgment-of-the-singapore-international-commercial-court-2024-sghc-i-24-thursday-15th-august-2024

MER's primary claim was dismissed (and attachments not lifted) on the basis that the subcontractors still had an interest in collecting their claims. The court, however, held that insofar as the standards of reasonableness and fairness were concerned, the position taken by TELEM and the subcontractors in these proceedings amounted to an unacceptable appeal with a blocking effect. Least not, given TELEM's failed attempts to have the award and enforcement set aside and that the enforceability of the award has not been impeded by TELEM's appeals in cassation. The subcontractors agreed or at least failed to object to conditions included by TELEM in its third-party attachment declarations, which the court held were severely damaging to MER. Contrarily, MER has taken into account the interests of the subcontractors, and the subcontractors did not respond to requests from MER to find a joint solution. The court, weighing the interests of the parties, ordered (1) the subcontractor's third-party attachment claims to be limited; (2) dismissal of TELEM's claim given the aforesaid restrictions which rendered TELEM without an interest in its claim; and (3) TELEM and the subcontractors to pay MER's legal costs.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/nl-mer-sint-maarten-bv-v-sint-maarten-telephone-company-nv-uitspraak-van-het-gerecht-in-eerste-aanleg-van-sint-maarten-thursday-25th-july-2024#decision_67016

The Contractor argued that the Employer had no authority to grant an extension of time, and therefore no authority to impose a fine. The Contractor further asserted that pursuant to Sub-Clause 44.1 the authority for determining an extension of time rests with the Engineer alone, and not the Employer. The Employer argued that pursuant to Sub-Clause 2.1 the Engineer cannot independently decide with respect to an extension of time and that the Engineer should obtain specific approval from the Employer before exercising any authority. The court held that Sub-Clause 2.1 is not applicable to Sub-Clause 44.1, and that the P24 order was therefore issued by the Employer without the necessary authority.

The Contractor terminated the contract for civil and electrical works in January 2021, citing delays in payment. The Employer issued a show-cause notice in June 2021, initiating its own termination proceedings. The contract included a dispute resolution mechanism, specifying steps for amicable settlement and arbitration. The Contractor filed a writ petition challenging the employer's right to terminate the contract, arguing that they had already terminated it and that the Employer had no authority to initiate proceedings to terminate the same. The Contractor also argued that the Employer, being a party to the contract, could not decide on the legality of the termination. The Contractor further sought a declaration that the contract had been validly terminated by it and that the Employer's show-cause notice was invalid, and for directions against the invocation of the bank guarantees. The Employer countered that the Contractor had breached the contract and that their termination proceedings were justified. The Employer argued that the Contractor in any event should have availed itself to the dispute resolution mechanism provided for in the contract, and that the proceedings in court were premature given that the Employer had only issued a show-cause notice at that point. The Employer further argued that payments were made in accordance with the contract, that the Contractor's delay to the works and termination were invalid and that the Contractor's continued defaults forced the Employer to initiate termination proceedings. The court considered whether the writ jurisdiction should be exercised and found that there was no public law element to entertain the writ petition. Accordingly, the Contractor's writ petition was dismissed. Without touching the merits of the matter, the court further held that the matter should be resolved through the contractual dispute resolution mechanism rather than in court, on the basis that the Employer had only issued a notice which the Contractor could respond to. The court cited several factors, including the complicated nature of the dispute, the availability of alternative remedies, and the principle that courts should generally avoid interfering in contractual matters.",Link,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/156016643/

Notably, it was common cause between the parties that neither party signed the (FIDIC) contract and the plaintiff did not plead any of the terms of the contract in its pleaded case. The plaintiff sought payment and interest for expenses relating to site establishment and standing time, not construction on the basis that the plaintiff never provided any service. The defendant denied the validity and legality of the contract and instituted counterclaims. A special plea of prescription was raised in response to the counterclaims, which the defendant argued was without merit on the basis that the plaintiff was aware of the illegality or should have reasonably known. Whether the claim and counterclaim succeed, revolved largely around the legality challenge made by the Defendant against the validity of the contract – if unsuccessful, it would be the end of the matter for the Defendant. The court found that the defendant's legality challenge was unduly delayed (7 years) and that the defendant had not provided a sufficient explanation for the delay. The court further concluded not to exercise its discretion to condone the undue delay. It followed that the Defendant's defence had not been proven and accordingly its counterclaim also failed In addition, given the court's acceptance of the Plaintiff's version (unrefuted by objective evidence) the defence on the merits also failed The Plaintiff's claim (including loss of profit) and interest was granted with costs and the Defendant's legality challenge to the validity of the contract dismissed with costs.",Link,https://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPPHC/2024/531.html

As to the first complaint concerning jurisdiction, Todini argued that the dispute was not referred to arbitration in accordance with the dispute resolution mechanism provided for under the contract, on the basis that the Roads Department had referred the matter to the DB and then brought the arbitration proceedings before the DB determination was issued. The Department asserted that this issue related to the admissibility of claims and not the arbitral jurisdiction. The court held that the issue was that of admissibility of the claims and not within the scope of an annulment, on the basis that temporarily overlapping proceedings do not deprive the tribunal of its jurisdiction.

The appeal was brought on the ground that the directions of the order were in contradiction to terms and conditions of the contract, which already prescribes the procedure for the final bill. The appellant argued that the Commercial Court erred in its interpretation of the contract terms - the contract provided that the contract provided that the performance certificate could only be issued (within 28 days) after the defects liability period is over and only thereafter is the final payment required and so the Respondent was not entitled to interim relief. The Respondent argued that interim relief granted by the Commercial Court under Section 9 application (of the 1996 Act) fell within the discretion of the court which required the court to balance the equities of the parties on even grounds and preserve the sanctity of the arbitral process. Further, if the discretion was exercised reasonably and in a judicial manner, a different view taken by a trial court would not necessarily justify an interference with such discretion. The court considered the terms of the contract, and agreed with the appellant that the stage of payment for the final bill had not been reached at the point when the Respondent approached the Commercial Court. The Court further held that pursuant to Sub-Clause 11.9 of the contract, the Contractor's obligations are only considered completed when the performance certificate is issued (i.e., acceptance of the works), which is subject to the Contractor supplying the necessary documents, completing all tests and works, and addressing all snags and defects. The court found that on the basis that there existed a dispute regarding items of the final bill (i.e., was not finalised) it was not open for the Commercial Court to issue interim measures as it could not be said that the Respondent had a prima facie case and that the balance of convenience lied in its favour. The court further held that the Commercial Court failed to exercise its discretion under Section 9 which required it to balance the equities between the parties. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed, and the Commercial Court's order was set aside and the interim relief granted quashed It was further noted that the observations made in the judgment would not affect any future proceedings between the parties.",Link,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/134772396/

The plaintiff also asserted that its claim was liquidated and thus appropriate to be determined summarily and that the defendant lacked any reasonable or triable defence for non-payment. The defendant admitted that the five decisions were issued, but opposed the application on the basis that notices of dissatisfaction were issued, accordingly it took the position that this application was premature for failure to exhaust the internal dispute mechanisms under Sub-Clause 20.5, which required parties to submit to amicable settlement and finally arbitration.

The court noted that whilst the defendant issued the notices of dissatisfaction, there was no effort to complete the dispute resolution clauses pursuant to Sub-Clauses 20.4 – 20.6.

The respondent contended that the tribunal failed to consider the effect of the agreement and the tender provisions on the FIDIC Conditions of Contract, instead the tribunal was said to have faulted by holding that the contract was governed only by the 1995 Orange Book. Accordingly, the respondent asserted that the tribunal considered matters that were not before it, that the tribunal re-wrote the contract between the parties and that the award was against the public policy of Kenya in respect of its decision regarding the rate of interest (computed monthly as opposed to the prevailing lending rates). The claimant opposed the application on the basis that the agreement between the parties took precedence over all other agreements, Sub-Clause 8 of the contract provided for a variation of price, and that the eot was granted pursuant to Sub-Clauses 2.2, 3.5 and 8.3 of the contract due to delays occasioned by the respondent (for which the award allowed for additional costs). As to the respondent's allegation that the award was against public policy, the claimant averred that the arbitration act granted the tribunal the discretion to determine the rate of interest to be applied to the award, that Sub-Clause 13.8 of the contract provided for the agreed interest rate and that the PPDR (Public Procurement and Disposal Regulations) provided that interest would be commercial rates. The main issue before the court for determination was whether or not the applicant (respondent) met the threshold for setting aside the arbitral award. The court found that the respondent failed to demonstrate how the award offended public policy, that there existed no sufficient grounds to warrant setting aside the arbitral award.

The contract, based on the 1999 FIDIC Yellow Book, was entered into for works at the Kusile Power Plant and comprised of three parts. The dispute between the parties arose under the second part of the contract (called the 'P24E Contract') which related to limestone works. The first dispute (the claims dispute), related to claims between the parties for additional costs and eot, and was bifurcated into two separate DAB proceedings; (1) in relation to a time-bar, which became the subject of arbitration proceedings, and (2) the merits and quantum of the claims, which the respondent before the court argued should be stayed pending finalisation of the arbitration proceedings and finalisation of the SIU Investigation. The DAB conveyed that the adjudication on the merits should proceed unless interdicted through an order of court. The respondent conceded the stay in proceedings (in relation to the merits) pending the arbitration, after the application was made to the court. The applicant, therefore, sought punitive costs. The court ordered for the merits aspect to be stayed pending the arbitration of the time-bar aspect of the claims dispute, but dismissed the applications for stay of those proceedings and stay of the termination dispute pending the SIU investigation.

The contract underwent seven signed modifications. A draft eighth modification was rejected, which was followed by termination of the contract. Disputes between the parties included: whether or not access to site was given, delays to approval of the final design, rejection of the claimant's proposed value engineering, validity of termination of the contract, whether or not the guarantees were performed in accordance with the contract, certain counterclaims and a dispute over the jurisdiction of the court particularly the admissibility of claims pursuant to the dispute resolution mechanisms set out under clause 20 and its interpretation in accordance with the Paraguayan laws. The contract underwent 7 signed modifications and one draft modification. The contract was terminated after draft modification number 8 was rejected As to the admissibility of claims, the parties disagreed over how the contract should be interpreted in the event of any contradictions between the usual interpretation of FIDIC contracts and the rules of interpretation under the laws of Paraguay. The respondent argued for a strict interpretation of the contract and asserted that the claims had lapsed as a result of non-compliance with the requirements under sub-clause 20.1. The claimant rejected the respondent's assertion that the claims lapsed on the basis that the parties agreed under the second memorandum of understanding for all claims under the contract to be submitted to arbitration and the requirements, particularly the 28-day period in sub-clause 20.1, were thus not applicable. The tribunal agreed with the claimants that the terms of the second memorandum of understanding reflected the willingness of the parties to submit any claim under the contract to arbitration, including the present claims. The court noted that under Paraguayan law, the court must interpret the contract without limiting itself to the literal meaning of its terms, but in accordance with the common intention of the parties, considering their total behaviour, even after conclusion of the contract.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/es-mota-engil-ingenieria-y-construccion-s-a-sucursal-paraguay-v-ministry-of-public-works-and-communications-of-paraguay-laudo-final-friday-8th-december-2023

This was a turnkey contract relating to the construction of a solar power plant. Zimbabwe Power Company (the Employer) undertook to pay for pre-commencement works by Intratrek's (the Contractor) subcontractors, but failed to pay, and therefore the works were not executed on time, or were not executed at all. The Employer sought an extension of time for six months, and Intratrek objected, as this was a breach of contract. The Employer then unilaterally terminated the contract, which Intratrek considered unlawful, and Intratrek applied for a court order declaring that the contract was valid and requiring specific performance, which was granted. The Employer appealed the court order and counterclaimed for breach of contract and misrepresentation. The Employer argued that the court had erred in finding that the condition precedents were waived; the Employer argued they were not and thus remained unfulfilled, and therefore the contract had never commenced. The Employer also argued that: fictional fulfilment (i.e. the Employer's deliberate frustration of conditions of the contract in order to unfairly benefit) did not occur; specific performance should not have been ordered; the judgment was not based on the case pleaded before them; and their counterclaim had been improperly dismissed. The Supreme Court considered the Employer's case was weak due to the strength of Intratrek's witness at the High Court (the Employer's witness did not provide any useful information, Intratrek's witness was therefore not controverted, and Intratrek's witness was found to be credible). The Supreme Court noted that an appeal court would not likely interfere with a trial court's findings on credibility. Further, the High Court had made findings of fact in favour of Intratrek, and the Supreme Court would not interfere with that. The Supreme Court decided that, as there was no meaningful evidence presented by the Employer, the counterclaim was dismissed and the appeal failed. The court order for specific performance of the contract, as applied for by Intratrek and appealed by the Employer, was upheld.",Link,https://zimlii.org/akn/zw/judgment/zwsc/2023/56/eng@2023-12-01

Vietnam Oil and Gas Group and PetroVietnam Technical Service Corporation, SIAC Case No. ARB274/19/AB, Final Award, 30 November 2023","Vietnam (governing law), Singapore (seat)",1999 Silver,"This is a final award for a SIAC arbitration seated in Singapore, with the law under Vietnamese jurisdiction and the language of the arbitration being English. Power Machines, a Russian company, and PetroVietnam Technical Service Corporation (PTSC), a Vietnamese company, together made up a Consortium of contractors and entered into a contract with Vietnam Oil & Gas Group (PVN, aka the Employer) in 2014 for the construction of a power plant in Vietnam (the Project), which commenced in 2015. The imposition of US sanctions on Russian companies in 2014, which included Power Machines, led to Power Machines' subcontractors being affected and suspending their work on the Project in 2018. This led to Power Machines and PVN both purporting to terminate the contract first. Power Machines issued a first Notice of Termination (NOT 1) in January 2019, and a second Notice of Termination (NOT 2) in February 2019. A dispute arose between the parties as to the effectiveness of these NOTs, with PVN also purporting to have terminated first as Power Machines' NOTs were ineffective. Power Machines referred the case to arbitration, seeking a declaration that the contract was validly terminated under Clause 19.6 of the contract, and payment from PVN due to: a wrongly called Performance Bond (Clause 4.5); Outstanding Payment Applications (Clause 14.5); Deferred Payment Charges (Clause 14.9); the cost of Preservation Works (Clause 16.3); Termination due to Force Majeure Events (Clause 19.6); and for unaccounted plant supplied to PVN (Clause 20.1). Power Machines argued that they had validly terminated the contract on 5 grounds: (i) that the US sanctions had constituted a force majeure event; and/or (ii) led to a release from performance under the law; and/or (iii) amounted to a substantial change in circumstances; and/or (iv) that PVN acted in breach of good faith; and/or (v) that PVN defaulted on the Outstanding Payment Applications. Power Machines argued that the first 4 grounds supported NOT 1, while the 5th ground supported NOT 2. PVN counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that Power Machines had wrongly invoked the Force Majeure clause and terminated the Agreement. PVN disputed Power Machines' right to terminate the Contract, asserting counterclaims for wrongful termination, delayed liquidated damages, financing damages, and the outstanding balance of the Advance Payment. PVN also sought a declaration holding Power Machines and PTSC jointly liable for Power Machines' breach of contract. PTSC opposed PVN's attempt to hold them jointly liable and sought costs for the proceedings from Power Machines and PVN. The Tribunal found Power Machines' NOT 1 ineffective, as they did not consider US Sanctions to constitute force majeure, but NOT 2 was effective as PVN had in that time defaulted on payments, entitling the Claimant to various payments, deferred charges, preservation work costs, Performance Bond recovery, and pre- and post-award interest. The Tribunal found that PVN was entitled to liquidated damages for delay and the outstanding balance of the Advance Payment.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-jsc-power-machines-v-vietnam-oil-and-gas-group-petrovietnam-and-petrovietnam-technical-service-corporation-award-wednesday-1st-november-2023

Further, the Contractor was now defunct, and the individuals enforcing the award had no power of attorney over the Contractor, and that it would be against public interest to enforce the international award.

The Singapore court stated that as a general principle, clear words are necessary to create a condition precedent to the commencement of arbitration.

On the facts of this case, the question that arose was whether Sub-Clause 20.5 (which was entirely substituted as set out below) constituted a condition precedent to arbitration. The Court concluded that it was not. This case does not assist with the interpretation of unamended Sub-Clause 20.5 of FIDIC. In this particular matter, Sub-Clause 20.5 was substituted as follows: ""(a) If any dispute arises out of or in connection with the Contract, or the execution of Works, including any dispute as to certification, determination, instruction, opinion or valuation of the Engineer, then either Party shall notify the other Party that a formal dispute exists.

The issue for determination was whether the defendant was in breach of the contract, entitling the plaintiff to the relief sought. The court noted that proof of performance of obligations or breach of contract is a matter of law of contract, therefore, civil law, and a party is required to prove its case on a balance of probabilities. The plaintiff's claim was for outstanding payment for work done and a retention amount. The plaintiff failed to plead quantum meruit in the alternative The defendant contended that the plaintiff was not entitled to the full payment of the contract price, as claimed, on the basis that the plaintiff had failed to complete the works. The court had to consider whether or not there was a variation to the contract, without which there could be no basis for payment over and above the contract price. The contractual procedures for a variation, including obtaining the Engineer's approval, was not followed. The court noted that the plaintiff was claiming under the contract and not under any variation, and were bound to their pleadings. On that point, the court held that it was not the court's duty to amend the contract and insert into it a further sum. The plaintiff did not pursue a final certificate for the remainder of the works, did not get a variation for work outside of the contractual scope and was bound by the contract it had entered into. The court found that there was no prayer to dispense with any requirement of the contract, that all valid certificates were paid, the purported draft final certificate was extra contractual, and therefore, there was no breach of contract on the part of the defendant who paid all valid certificates raised to date. Accordingly, the plaintiff's claim was held to be baseless and untenable in law, it failed to invoke the court's equity jurisdiction to quantum meruit, and the entire claim in limine was dismissed with costs to the defendant. The only rider was that, whilst the plaintiff did not demand payment of the retention money (which was thus not in dispute), that sum was due to them.",Link,https://kenyalaw.org/caselaw/cases/view/271738/

The plaintiff's position was that pursuant to Sub-Clause 20.4 the defendant was required to promptly give effect to the decision of a DB, regardless whether it was binding or final and binding, and that the defendant therefore had no reasonable defence for non-payment of sums awarded. The defendant opposed the application and sought its dismissal on the basis that there were triable issues, which it held, ought to be referred to arbitration on the basis that under the FIDIC Pink Book the decision of a DB is not final and open to review or appeal through arbitration and that enforcement of a DB decision could only follow once the mechanism for arbitration had been exhausted – i.e., a three-pronged dispute resolution mechanism being: determination by DB, amicable settlement and lastly, arbitration. The defendant held that the plaintiff's application was therefore not ripe for determination and that it should be granted leave to defend the suit on the basis that the DB decision was non-contractual, unlawful and illegal and that all claims were settled following termination of the contract. The defendant, accordingly, applied for a stay in proceedings pending reference to arbitration. The court held that: (1) under Sub-Clause 20.4 the obligations imposed by a DB decision is binding on the parties and enforceable unless it is set aside by amicable settlement or by arbitration, following a Notice of Dissatisfaction – the wording ""unless and until"" underpins the duty to comply with its obligations; (2) the right to enforce the DB decision is preserved by Sub-Clause 20.7, either by arbitration or through court action; and (3) there was no reason to stay the proceedings as the defendant failed to raise any issue for trial or determination by the court.

There were two grounds for review before court, one in relation to non-compliance with tender requirements, and second relating to change in specification, including major design changes, which the Applicant asserted amounted to tender manipulation (to the advantage of the Second Respondent). Both grounds were found without foundation, a summary regarding the first follows. Mandatory requirements were set out in the bid document, and it was made clear that a bidder would be disqualified if the “mandatory returnables” were not completed. The issue before court was what was meant by one of the returnables - described as the “completed FIDIC schedule and contract data”, which included an appendix. The First Respondent's primary position was that the Applicant had not provided the mandatory information, without which it was unable to properly assess a bid. The appendix was available on the website and it contended that the bidder had a duty to access documents online, fill it in and return it. The Applicant asserted that the mandatory requirements were cryptic and unclear and that it was impossible to comply with as the term FIDIC contract data had no generally accepted meaning. Whilst it was accepted that a meaning was included in the second edition of the red book (2017), there was no reference to such a term in the 1999 FIDIC red book which was the version used for this contract. The Applicant further questioned why the appendix was not expressly referred to as the mandatory returnable document. On the basis that the appendix was available on the website, the court held that there was no burden to decipher unclear directions, and that a diligent bidder would have accessed the document from the website as instructed and seen from its contents that it was something that it was required to complete and return. The court found that the tender was not unfair, nor was it irrational for the First Respondent to have disqualified the bidder for non-compliance.

The Claimant contended that the addendum was approved by the Employer, whilst the JV and second Defendant argued that it was not.

The dispute concerned a DAB decision in respect of which the defendant had issued a notice of dissatisfaction and intention to commence arbitration pursuant to Sub-Clause 20.4. The applicant (defendant) asserted that the plaintiff's application for enforcement of the said decision was premature. The plaintiff took the view that the defendant's application was bad in law and res judicata applied on the basis that similar applications had been previously determined and dismissed The question before court centred around the interpretation of Sub-Clause 20.4 and whether it permits enforcement of a DAB decision once issued or whether enforcement had to await completion of the arbitration process in circumstances where a notice of dissatisfaction and intention to commence arbitration had been given. The court noted that with regards to interpretation, the court had to consider the contract as a whole and determine the intention of the parties and the purpose of agreeing the dispute resolution process. The defendant argued that under Sub-Clause 20.4 the DAB decision was binding, but provisional and not final and therefore not yet enforceable. Also, the defendant took the view that a notice of dissatisfaction required the parties to engage in attempting settlement, failing which, proceed with arbitration. The court held that whilst provisional at this stage, the intention of the parties was to have the decision promptly effected, the other processes (amicable settlement and arbitration) notwithstanding. Accordingly, the court found that: (1) it was the intention of the parties that the DAB decision under Sub-Clause 20.4 though not final, was nonetheless binding and enforceable and must be enforced on the basis that it immediately confers a positive obligation on the paying party; (2) that the next stage of proceedings would not prevent implementation of that decision; (3) the final and binding decision from arbitration is not a condition precedent to enforcement of the DAB decision; and (4) agreed with the plaintiff that the application was res judicata, the court having already pronounced itself on the issues and interpretation of the contentious clauses.

The arbitration hearing and proceedings were still in progress when this application was brought and argued. The first respondent's position was that IPC no. 17 included amounts relating to certain variation orders which it held the applicant was not entitled to on the basis that those were not issued in compliance with the contract and had not been approved by the first respondent. It asserted that the contract provisions authorised the Engineer to revise and correct IPC no. 17 with IPC no. 18 (which, in contrast with IPC no. 17, was not signed by the Engineer). IPC no.18 reversed the disputed variation orders and included delay damages (as a deduction) for which it said the applicant was liable. Accordingly, the first respondent admitted liability to the applicant for a specific amount. Under scrutiny was the legal effect of interim payment certificates. The court held that none of the contractual provisions granted interim payment certificates the character of something that vests an absolute or temporarily final right to payment of the amount certified thereby if it is in dispute. That nothing was found or had been referred to that indicated the first respondent waived or abandoned the right to raise a contractual defence to resist a claim for payment in terms of an IPC. The court held that the parties agreed that the arbitration would finally settle their disputes, therefore, the applicant could not obtain enforcement of the disputed IPC prior to the final arbitration award, save insofar as the first respondent's admitted indebtedness. Accordingly, the certificate would only be enforceable to the extent of its consistency with the award. For this reason, the court found the application premature prior to completion of the arbitration proceedings since the right to payment of the balance of IPC no.17 would be determined by the arbitrator's award. Regarding IPC 18, the court held that nothing in the contract prescribed the form of IPCs and it was deemed immaterial that it was not signed by the Engineer. However, the court held that it was doubtful that Sub-Clause 14.6 provided the Engineer with authority to issue a certificate correcting an earlier contested certificate which was the subject of arbitration proceedings as that would trench, impermissibly, on the arbitrator's function concerning the dispute. Accordingly, such purported correction or modification could not be deemed to have been properly made within the meaning of the relevant phrase under Sub-Clause 14.6.

Two IPC 36's were issued, one on 6 August 2015 and a revised IPC 36 on 1 September 2016, which the defendant asserted was agreed by the parties (signed) and replaced the previous one. The second IPC 36, the centre of this dispute, was issued not only deducting sums for delay damages, but also excluding payment to the plaintiff for preliminaries and generals (P&G) and a contract price adjustment (CPA). The dispute before court was whether or not the plaintiff was entitled to be paid its P&Gs and the CPA certified under the first IPC 36. In relation to P&Gs, the court held that the contract was clear – unless the plaintiff receives an eot, it is not entitled to its P&G for that period. The plaintiff did not apply for one. As to the amendment of IPC 36, it cannot be withdrawn and its only amendment is to be in the form of a further interim payment certificate. The court held that Sub-Clause 14.6 clearly provides that an amount may be rectified in a subsequent payment certificate or under the final accounting exercise pursuant to Sub-Clause 14.13. Accordingly, the defendant had no right to object to this IPC and the Engineer had no right to amend it. As to the defendant's assertion that the parties agreed to replace this IPC, no waiver or acquiescence was pleaded or properly proven. The plaintiff succeeded in its claim.",Link,http://www.saflii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl?file=za/cases/ZAGPPHC/2023/2245.html&query=fidic

The arbitration related to a construction contract wherein the employer and contractor agreed to appoint the engineer as the sole authority to confirm the quality, volume, and progress of the contractor's work, and that only work confirmed by the engineer would be legally binding. The employer terminated the contract, citing serious breaches by the contractor. The contractor disputed the termination, claiming it was unjustified. The tribunal partially sided with the employer, ordering the contractor to pay outstanding balances, interest, and arbitration fees, but rejecting the employer's claim for delay damages. The contractor appealed the award on grounds that: the tribunal failed to consider the role of the engineer as the sole authority for confirming work; the tribunal relied on the employer's figures, which were not confirmed by the engineer; the tribunal did not summon the engineer to provide expert testimony; and the tribunal's decision violated the contractual agreement between the parties and undermined the principle of equality.

The court held that the award was inappropriate and the violations of procedural errors were irreparable. The court confirmed that the award was contrary to the basic principles of the law of Vietnam and the provisions of the Commercial Arbitration Law, and the court accepted the request to set aside the award. The court also agreed with the second ground, but disagreed with the third ground on the basis that an application to set aside an arbitral award was not an opportunity for a retrial of the content of the dispute. Concerning the fourth ground, which related to Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims], the Contractor argued that the Employer failed to issue a valid Sub-Clause 2.5 claim, and therefore, lost its right to claim.

15,2023,Geita town council vs M/S Home Africa Investment Corporation Limited (Misc. Commercial Application No. 06 of 2022) [2023] TZHCComD 155 (26 May 2023),"High Court of Tanzania, at Mwanza",Not specified,"This is an application for an extension of time to challenge an arbitral award. A key point in this case was that allegations such as illegality of the award or that the contract was not a FIDIC contract, could only be judged if the award was visible before the court. Geita, the Employer, argued that the award was illegal: firstly, because the arbitrator had interpreted the underlying contract as a FIDIC contract, which the Employer argued that it was not; secondly, on the grounds that the arbitrator had acted beyond its power by affirming the adjudication award and not considering the evidence or the facts. The Employer argued that the arbitrator had treated the matter as an appeal against the adjudicator award and not on the merits of its case, the former of which the Employer argued was beyond the arbitrator's powers. It also protested the award on the grounds that there was ambiguity and uncertainty in the award. M/S Home Africa, the Contractor, objected to the application on the grounds that it was premature, as there was no award to be challenged: the Contractor argued that if their award was not filed, it could not be challenged. Furthermore, the Employer had been ordered to file the award, but had failed to do so, and had also failed to account for the delay in doing so. The Contractor also argued that the Employer's questions of illegality should first be dealt with by an arbitration tribunal, in accordance with statutory law, rather than in court. The court decided in favour of the Contractor, dismissing the application. The court agreed with the Contractor in that the application was filed prematurely and that the court could only decide on the award if it was before the court. The court also highlighted the difference between the requirement to file the award and issues of illegality. Whether the underlying contract was a FIDIC contract or not was not considered by the court, as it could not consider the facts without reviewing the award first. The Court acknowledged the Employer's argument that illegality was a good cause for extension of time to challenge an arbitration award, but also agreed with the Contractor in that a court could not grant an extension of time on grounds of illegality if there was no award before it. The illegality was clearly not of sufficient importance as there was no award before the court, and therefore the court could not act. In this case, as the application was premature, it lacked merit and was dismissed.",Link,https://tanzlii.org/akn/tz/judgment/tzhccomd/2023/155/eng@2023-05-26

The central issue before court was whether the arbitration agreement between the parties denied them the opportunity to seek leave to appeal an arbitration award on errors of law. The court noted that the Arbitration Act contemplated three different scenarios regarding appeals to the court on questions of law - the arbitration agreement may expressly provide for, be silent on, or preclude such appeals. In this case the arbitration agreement did not positively provide that a party could appeal an award. The applicant sought leave to appeal on the basis that the arbitration agreement did not address appeals at all, including appeals on questions of law. The application judge dismissed the request for leave to appeal and held that the arbitration agreement (contract) dealt with appeals - it precluded them by saying that disputes would be ""finally settled"" by arbitration and by incorporating the ICC Rules, including the rule stating that parties agreed to carry out any award and waived any form of recourse. In short, leave to appeal was not possible, both under contract and the ICC Rules, thus the precondition to seeking it under s. 45(1) of the Arbitration Act was not met. The applicant sought to: (i) reverse the application judge's decision about the arbitration agreement precluding appeals on questions raised; (ii) grant leave to appeal on the questions raised; and (iii) for the appeal itself to be determined by the Superior Court.

The plaintiff's partial appeal. The plaintiff's appeal concerned a claim for damages resulting from the defendant's unilateral termination. The court, however, found that the breach of contract was entirely the plaintiff's fault and that the defendant's termination was valid. The court held that the plaintiff had to bear its own damages. The plaintiff asserted that the slow progress was caused by the defendant, due to: (1) late handover of the premises; (2) late payments by the defendant; and (3) slow approval of VOs. In respect of the first, the court agreed that the site handover was late. As to late payments, the court rejected the plaintiff's arguments on the basis that by the date of termination the plaintiff received an amount beyond the actual value (advanced payment plus payments received during construction). Regarding late approvals of VOs, the court disagreed with the plaintiff on the basis that the latter did not comply with the contractual procedures. The plaintiff further asserted that the defendant implicitly extended the contractual period for completion by agreeing to extend the advance guarantee and performance guarantee. The court rejected this argument, and held that those are only measures to ensure financial security when executing the contract, and did not automatically extend the contract. The defendant appealed the entire judgment on the basis that the court of first instance failed to fully consider the agreement between the parties and specific evidence when allowing the plaintiff's request, and by denying the defendant's counterclaim. The defendant asserted that as a result of the contractor's delayed progress, it had to reduce the contractor's scope of work and employ and assign those over to other contractors in order to progress the project (decreasing the contractor's contract, the parties agreed the fair value). The defendant sought payment for damages, for: (1) delay damages; (2) difference paid by the defendant to replacement contractors; (3) compensation for materials left overdue, damaged, or lost by the plaintiff; (3) damages for costs incurred due to delay in handing over the site to the interior finishings contractor; and (4) remedial costs. The court granted all, except #3 (materials), of the defendant's counterclaims. The defendant also appealed against the decision that the advance guarantee was no longer valid. The court noted that defendant's termination due to the plaintiff's fault, does not take away the right to request performance of the guaranteed obligation and that the bank had an obligation to perform. Both the guarantee to repay the advance payment and the contract performance guarantee were held to be unconditional and irrevocable. The court further noted that the guarantor was entitled to request repayment from the claimant, failing which, it was entitled to liquidate assets of the claimant held as collateral. On the above basis, the court accepted part of the plaintiff's appeal, partly accepted the defendant's appeal and amended the judgment of the court of first instance.",Link,https://congbobanan.toaan.gov.vn/2ta1174708t1cvn/chi-tiet-ban-an

Central Bank of Iraq, ICC Case No. 26290/AYZ/ELU, final Award 26 Feb 2023","Paris, ICC",2006 White 4th ed,"Dispute concerning the Respondent's failure to settle outstanding invoices, which breach led to the Claimant suspending the works and demobilising. The Claimant's claims included: (1) payment of the outstanding invoices; (2) payment of the remaining contract value for the services which were supposed to be performed until the end of the contract; (3) interest; and (4) and order directing the Respondent to return to the Claimant the performance bond and legals costs associated with opposing the call before the Dubai Courts. The Respondent failed to file any submission during the normal course of the proceedings, instead after the closing of pleadings and without leave from the Tribunal, filed an application making submissions on alleged fraudulent representation and legal consequences. The submissions and evidence produced were declared inadmissible. Pursuant to Sub-Clause 8.1.1 the parties attempted to resolve the dispute amicably. Two meetings between the parties were noted, with the Claimant's representatives arrested during the second meeting, which effectively ended any reasonable prospect of amicable resolution between the parties. The Claimant issued a notice of mediation in accordance with Sub-Clause 8.2.1, which received no answer from the Respondent. The Claimant elected not to request the appointment of a mediator and asserted that Sub-Clause 8.2.1, by use of the word may, granted an option to request that the mediator be appointed. The tribunal found that the word may does not make mediation optional as such interpretation would be irreconcilable with Sub-Clause 8.2.7. The tribunal had to decide to what extent the Claimant was entitled to commence the arbitral proceedings in light of its failure to comply with Sub-Clause 8.2.7. Under French law the issue of non-compliance raised a question of admissibility and not one of jurisdiction and that under French law such non-compliance could be excused on the grounds of futility – the claims were held to be admissible. As to the claims, the Tribunal found that the invoices were validly dispatched in accordance with Sub-Clause 5, the principles of good faith and estoppel. On the basis that the Respondent failed to contest the invoices in accordance with the time-limit and mechanism under Sub-Clause 5, the Claimant had a contractual right to payment. Accordingly, the Respondent breached its payment obligations by failing to make payment within 30 days, was held to have no valid reasons for non-payment and was ordered to pay the outstanding amount plus interest. Re the remaining value of the contract. The Claimant asserted that under Iraqi law, damages are recognised to include loss of profit to the extent this is reasonably foreseeable and would definitely be incurred in the future. The Claimant was wrongly deprived of the outstanding value as a result of the Respondent's unjustifiable breach of contract, which forced its suspension and demobilisation. The Respondent was ordered to pay those damages, consisting of actual losses (salaries and other costs) and loss of profit, plus interest. With regards to the Claimant's claim in relation to the performance bond. The Tribunal held that there was no evidence to indicate that the Claimant breached any of its contractual obligations, the Respondent therefore wrongfully called the guarantee and accordingly the costs incurred to oppose the call had to be compensated for in accordance with the Iraqi Civil Code. Further, pursuant to Sub-Clause 5.1.5, the Tribunal held that the guarantee had to be released and that the Respondent should no longer be able to call on the guarantee, and ordered the Respondent to take the necessary steps to release it.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-cardno-me-limited-v-central-bank-of-iraq-final-award-sunday-26th-february-2023

Ltd on 2 February, 2023","High Court of India, at Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, Srinagar",Silver (Year not specified),"An appeal against an arbitration award, based on a turnkey contract for the construction of seven bridges on a road. The original dispute centred on claims for additional payment by the Contractor (Singla Constructions) arising from an entitlement to an extension of time caused by the Employer's (Union Territory) delay. Union Territory counterclaimed for liquidated damages and the cost of replacing a bridge that was destroyed by an avalanche. The arbitration tribunal found in favour of Singla Constructions, awarding significant damages. A lower court upheld the award. Union Territory appealed the award and the lower court's decision on the grounds that: Singla had failed to provide timely notices of claim under clause 20.1 of the FIDIC contract and had accepted the final payments without protest – this failure to comply with clause 20.1 invalidated Singla's claims; the arbitration award and the lower court's decision were illegal and against public policy; the arbitrators made awards on matters outside of the scope of the arbitration agreement; and the contract was a turnkey contract, and therefore the contractor was responsible for all aspects of the project. The court upheld certain aspects of the award, such as the refund of payments and increased minimum wage costs, but set aside significant portions that related to variations and prolongation costs and emphasised the importance of contractual compliance and the nature of the turnkey contract. The court also criticised the arbitrators for failing to properly consider the terms of the contract and for not considering the fact that the contractor had not first raised any dispute with the Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB) as per the contract.",Link,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/74191007/

17,2022,Ledger v Leeor [2022] DIFC CA 013 (26 October 2022),The Dubai International Financial Centre Courts,1992 Red 4th ed,"A Court of Appeal judgment, heard ex parte, against a judgment refusing an urgent ex parte application for an interim anti-suit injunction. The court looked at the applicable test for anti-suit injunctions where the seat of the arbitration is in contention and discussed circumstances in which the DIFC might have jurisdiction to grant such relief in circumstance where it is not the seat. The project concerned construction of a residential building in Dubai. A dispute (relating to delay and monies owed) arose out of a 4th edition FIDIC Red contract, modified by particular conditions which provided for arbitration as the final mode of dispute resolution (the ""Arbitration Agreement""). The particular conditions provided that disputes were to be (1) resolved by an Engineer's Decision, and if such decision has not become final and binding, (2) parties were to attempt reaching an amicable settlement, (3) failing which, disputes were to be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration and Conciliation of the DIFC-LCIA (Dubai International Financial Centre and the London Court of International Arbitration) by an arbitral tribunal consisting of three members. The PCs further provided that the place of arbitration was Dubai. The Respondent notified the Appellants of the Engineer's failure to give notice of the decision referred to it, of its intention to commence arbitration proceedings and requested an amicable settlement meeting. Notwithstanding the aforesaid notice, the Respondent commenced proceedings in the Dubai Court of First Instance instead in breach of the provisions of the Arbitration Agreement. This was met by a jurisdictional challenge by the Appellant with reference to the Arbitration Agreement. Appellant also made a further application to the Joint Judicial Committee seeking a stay of the proceedings – which was not granted. The Appellants were unsuccessful in both actions and the Dubai Court then proceeded to consider the case on its merits. The Appellant then instituted Part 8 proceedings in the DIFC-CFI for a declaration, inter alia, that the seat of the arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement was the DIFC. The Court noted that in circumstances where the parties are bound by an arbitration agreement and the seat is the DIFC, the DIFC Court will grant anti-suit injunctions where necessary. On the basis that this was an application in circumstances where the seat of arbitration was disputed, the Court accepted it had the power to exercise grant an interim anti-suit injunction, but had to consider the Appellant's submissions as to the test to be applied to the exercise of that power – i.e., the applicant had to show to a high degree of probability that there was a binding agreement that disputes would be determined by arbitration seated in the DIFC. Alternatively, if the seat was not DIFC, whether this was an exceptional case in which the Court could nevertheless grant an anti-suit injunction. The judge rejected the notion that 'place' meant 'venue' on the basis that venue does not form part of the Arbitration Agreement, and in any event, is usually agreed and determined by the parties and tribunal, but accepted that it was ""at least likely"" that the parties agreed the seat as Dubai. The Judge did not finally decide the interpretive issue – as it could not be said that there was a high degree of probability of a binding Arbitration Agreement with DIFC as its seat. He could not therefore grant an anti-suit injunction on that basis, even assuming that he was satisfied that the Respondent was in breach of the Arbitration Agreement – which breach the Appellants argued made this case exceptional The application was dismissed and the Appellants were granted permission to appeal on the basis that there is another compelling reason for the appeal to be heard – this was to give the Court an opportunity to give guidance on the interpretation of Decree 43 and on the test to be applied in granting anti-suit injunctions in arbitration matters where there is a dispute as to the identity of the seat - demonstrating the intertwined issues of procedural fairness and judicial comity between the two court systems in Dubai.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-ledger-v-leeor-judgment-of-the-court-of-appeal-of-the-dubai-international-financial-centre-courts-2022-difc-ca-013-wednesday-26th-october-2022

The Employer alleged that the Contractor had breached their contract by suspending works and for not giving requisite notice per Sub-Clause 16.1 [Contractor’s Entitlement to Suspend Work]. The Employer applied for an order for specific performance also alleging that the Contractor had failed to achieve mandated performance levels. The Court noted that the contract provided for payment certification in Sub-Clause 14.7 [Issue of Advance and Interim Payment Certificates] and payment in Sub-Clause 14.8 [Payment]. The Court noted that Sub-Clause 14.8 did not require a formal notice to be raised for non-payment. The Contractor informed the Employer that payment was overdue on 09/09/2022 in breach of Sub-Clause 14.8. The letter was not produced before the court. On 26/09/2022 the Contractor issued a letter marked as a notice, referring to the letter dated 09/09/2022 and stating it would suspend work on 30/09/2022 if payment was not satisfied. The Employer objected that the Notice was not contractual, giving them only 4 days to resolve matters and did not sufficiently refer to Sub-Clause 16.1. The Court did not agree. Acknowledging it did not possess the letter dated 9 September 2022 it held that the letter dated 26 September 2022 was a reminder and that the Employer would have been fully aware of the potential suspension. As the Contractor was entitled to suspend the works the Employer's request for an order of specific performance failed Sub-Clause 16.2 [Termination by Contractor] was discussed but only in the context of this being a consequence had the Applicant failed to resolve the non-payment of funds. Sub-Clause 1.3 was referenced as requiring a notice to be described as such and that it must include a reference to the clause under which it is issued During the application proceedings the Employer referred to a DAB decision against the Contractor and penalties awarded to the Employer which were meant to set off against IPC payments. The Court noted that it was important that neither of the IPC's the Employer failed to pay in full referred to a DAB decision or an entitlement to make deductions. The Court added that the Employer made no mention of the DAB proceedings until the Reply stage and that they were initiated after the application in hand was issued",Link,http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAECMKHC/2022/83.pdf

The structure was imported from Singapore by the Respondent, cleared through customs, but never delivered to site. The contract was terminated by the Appellant. The structure was not returned to the Appellant, which it asserted should have devolved to it upon completion or termination of the contract. The Respondent asserted that ownership in the structure did not pass to the Appellant, that it had used it to discharge its obligation under the contract (to provide accommodation), that temporary facilities provided under the contract always remain the property of the contractor, and that it was under a duty to remove it following the Appellant's termination of the contract since only permanent works devolve to the Employer. The appellant appealed on grounds that the trial judge erred by: (1) allowing the respondent to amend its pleadings after close of pleadings; (2) an incorrect interpretation of Sub-Clause 16.2 of the contract; (3) failing to find that pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.2 the appellant was the owner of the prefabricated houses; and (4) finding that the respondent had no obligation to build living quarters for the workers. The appellant failed on all 4 grounds, accordingly the application was dismissed. As to ground 1, the court found that the amendment had to do with evidence which had already been introduced during the hearing and without objection by the Appellant. Accordingly, it was found that the amendment was to align the pleadings with the evidence subject to the Appellant's right to adduce evidence relating to the new pleading. Ground 1 thus had no merit and was dismissed Grounds 2 – 4 related to the interpretation of and applicability (scope and limitations) of Sub-Clauses 15.2 and 16.2. The court considered the items of work that must be returned to the Employer, and held that 'other work' related to the Permanent Work and not temporary work. Therefore, Sub- Clause 15.2 applied, not Sub-Clause 16.2. The court also failed to see how the prefabricated house imported by the Respondent could be the property of the Appellant.

At the time of termination, Tangerm had fully executed the first contract and only executed 61% of the second contract. Payment remained outstanding, and as a result of the Employer failing to fulfil their undertakings, Tangerm sued for breach of contract. Tangerm argued that the inability to fully execute the projects were due to many reasons, namely that the Employer had: issued unilateral changes to the design and construction methodology; only handed over 61% of the second site, causing delay and suspension of works; delayed takeover of the first site; delayed payment of most of the certified amounts; and failed to settle final accounts so the contractor could not demobilize. Tangerm argued that the Employer had acted negligently in performance of the contract and sought payment. The Employer argued that the variations were mutually agreed upon and within their rights to make; that payments were made as per the contract terms; that the claims regarding mobilisation and others were speculative and unsupported; and that all issues were discussed and mutually resolved. The court decided in favour of Tangerm, but did not think that the Employer had committed a breach of contract. The court acknowledged that variations were made and additional works were performed based on site instructions, and therefore Tangerm was entitled to compensation for these additional works. However, as the variations were mutually agreed upon, they did not constitute a breach of contract; delays in payment or delayed approval of IPCs did also not constitute a breach in this case, as Tangerm had not provided sufficient evidence as to the exact submission dates for the IPCs, and therefore there was no evidence of non-payment within the contractual period and therefore no evidence of breach due to delayed payments.",Link,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjd6pOwloWNAxXEAfsDHVP1OO4QFnoECBsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tanzlii.org%2Fmedia%2Fjudgment%2F281538%2Fsource_file%2Fjv-tangerm-construction-co-ltd-technocombine-construction-ltd-a-joint-venture-vs-tanzania-ports-authority-another-2022-tzhc-10479-4-july-2022.pdf&usg=AOvVaw38rd7GuGyiiZRcuhG_LTJ1&opi=89978449

The award related to a contract for the improvement and expansion of the Phase 1 sewerage system of the city of Quibdó in Chocó Department, Colombia. The Contractor was the Epic Quibdó Consortium, while the Employer was Fiduciaria la Previsora S.A, who administered the ""Todos Somos PAZcífico Plan"" fund. The Contractor claimed that several issues hampered their performance, including: inaccurate pre-contractual information (e.g. designs, public service installations, soil information) which also differed significantly from actual site conditions; the acquired machinery was unsuitable for site conditions; requests for corrected plans were met with delayed and incomplete responses; and also unforeseen events like public disturbances, excessive rainfall, the Atrato River flooding, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Employer, however, claimed that the Contractor breached the contract due to their failure to: (1) correct required defects; (2) adhere to the agreed-upon schedule; (3) pay staff wages and social benefits; (4) implement agreed-upon safety and signalling measures; (5) comply with orders to resume work; and (6) also by submitting performance and advance payment guarantees that were ""non-existent, ineffective, or null."" As a result of these alleged breaches by the Contractor, the Employer declared a definitive and total breach of contract and subsequently terminated the contract. The Tribunal largely found in favour of the Employer, finding the Contractor in breach of contract and liable for significant financial compensation (a net sum of over $9bn) to the Employer. The Tribunal further found that: (1) the contract was validly formed; (2) responsibility for designs and pre- contractual conditions rested with the Employer; (3) the exception of ""planning duty"" was proven in favour of the Employer; (4) the Contractor materially breached the contract, as confirmed by prior resolutions; (5) guarantees provided by the Contractor were deemed non-existent, and therefore (6) termination of the contract by the Employer was valid.",Link,https://bibliotecadigital.ccb.org.co/bitstreams/a2c37ec0-0ace-4d6e-b39e-2bb39da4549c/download

The final award is elsewhere on this table. The project was divided into three sections, JV Copri (the Contractor) was awarded all three contracts all of which were modified forms of the FIDIC Red book, and all of which incorporated the tiered dispute resolution mechanism. The Contractor submitted two claims relating to two of the contracts for additional time and remuneration for costs incurred as a result of delays caused by the Employer. The Engineer granted the Contractor an EOT and additional remuneration in its determination, which the Employer contested. The parties realised that the DAB had yet to be constituted This led to an agreed amendment to the contracts concerning the dispute resolution mechanism up to before referral of the dispute to arbitration. Following this ad hoc DAB proceedings were instituted which two decisions also decided that the Contractor was due monies, albeit no reference was made to VAT (the contract price excluded VAT). Following the DAB decisions, an independent audit was instituted by the Public Finance Inspectorate on suspicion that irregularities may have occurred during the conclusion of the amendments, which irregularities were finally found. The Director General of ARA and the former Director of PMU were both charged, however, the charges of fraud were dropped and they were acquitted from the charges of abuse of authority. In the meantime, and as a result of the Employer's failure to make payment in accordance with the DAB decisions, the Contractor referred the two disputes to arbitration, which were joined under a single case number. The Tribunal firstly declared that it had the requisite jurisdiction to hear the matter and declared the DAB decisions final and binding on the Employer who was ordered to pay the Contractor immediately. The Respondent/Employer brough this appeal on grounds of (1) alleged incompetence of the Tribunal; (2) alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the VAT claims; (3) an alleged violation of international public policy; (4) an alleged abuse of procedure, and asked for an annulment of the award. The Contractor resisted the appeal on all grounds. As to the first ground, the court rejected the appellant's argument and held that the amendments to the contract only made changes to the dispute resolution process prior to referral of the dispute to arbitration and that the parties' common will to submit their dispute to arbitration was not modified by the amendments. The second ground, concerning the Tribunal's jurisdiction regarding VAT, was also rejected on the basis that this was a question of admissibility and did not fall within consideration of an annulment. As to the question of public policy, whilst the court noted that the charges against the DG of ARA and Director of PMU were abandoned, such circumstance alone would in any event not necessarily constitute a violation of international public policy. As to the final ground, the court held that the appellant was mistaken about the extent of its rights.

The parties entered into a subcontract, wherein the Subcontractor provided mechanical and electrical services to the Contractor, who was employed by HVTS (the Employer, together the Respondents). During the project, the claimant's value of works carried out increased beyond the initially agreed amount. Upon completion of the project, the claimant submitted requests for payment from the Contractor, which was paid in part (the original contract amount). The claimant commenced proceedings against both the Contractor and Employer for the outstanding amount, against the latter pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.7 of the subcontract which specified that pursuant to Sub-Clause 59.5 of the Main Contract (1987 Red Book), the Subcontractor was entitled to receive certified payments, not made by the Contractor, directly from the Employer. The claimant (Subcontractor) asserted that the Employer was liable for payment on behalf of the Contractor as a result of the latter's breach of its payment obligations. The respondents (HVTS together with BUCG) argued that the claimant was only entitled to the initial amount, due to various factors during the project, including: fines relating to safety violations, construction quality issues, violating the construction schedule, previously agreed negotiations between the parties to cut or change certain expenses, and a warranty fee, of which the respondents were entitled to keep 50% up to 2 years after the completion of the project. The respondents also argued that the claimant was not entitled to payment from the Employer as the project manager had not issued a Taking Over Certificate (10.1) nor had they confirmed that the contractor had not paid in full. Both the Court of first instance and Court of Appeal agreed with the Claimant. The Supreme Court, however, disagreed with the preceding judgments. The Supreme Court held that the conditions in the subcontract agreement were not met (i.e., the Taking Over Certificate), and that the correct interpretation of Sub-Clause 16.7 (referring to Sub-Clause 59.5) was that the Subcontractor merely had a right to receive payment from the Employer (provided that it was certified), and not a right to claim payment from the Employer on the basis that the Employer was not a party to the agreement. Further, the court held that the Subcontract and other agreements between the claimant and Contractor took precedence over the principle of 'fairness', and that the claimant had agreed to the provisions deducting certain fees and allowing the Contractor to maintain part of their fees as a warranty fee. The preceding judgments were overturned, and the matter was sent back to the lower court for retrial.",Link,https://anle.toaan.gov.vn/webcenter/portal/anle/chitietnguonanle?dDocName=TAND284154

The Contractor submitted 22 claims to the Engineer. The Contractor asserts that some of its claims were wrongly rejected by the Engineer, which led to the commencement of this arbitration. The Respondent denied the Claimant's claims on the basis that the contract was amended by subsequent addendums, following which the Claimant was either estopped from bringing claims and/or the claims was not made in accordance with the contract (as amended), alternatively that the Claimant failed to provide the requisite supporting evidence. The Respondent also brought a counterclaim, claiming a refund of amount allegedly overpaid to the Claimant for costs of the delay caused by the general elections, inclement weather and costs associated with VAT administration plus interest. The Respondent argued that the Tribunal had the power pursuant to Sub-Clause 20.6 to open up and review and revise any determination of the Engineer. The Claimant averred the Respondent's counterclaim had no legal basis and was unsubstantiated by any evidence. The Tribunal held that Addendum 2 did not waive the contractual requirement for notice under Sub-Clause 20.1 in respect of the claims brought which were not listed under Addendum 2. Those claims brought which did not fall under Addendum 2 did not comply with the notice requirement and therefore rightly rejected by the Engineer and that the Claimant was not entitled to EOT in respect thereof. The Claimant also failed to demonstrate its entitlement to additional payments such as delay/prolongation costs (as a result of no EOT). The Claimant was also not entitled to disruption costs (for lack of evidence), fluctuation of currencies, VAT or interest. The Respondent's counterclaim also failed for lack of evidence. Accordingly, neither party established its entitlement to any of the reliefs sought in these proceedings. As to costs, each party was ordered to bear its own legal costs and costs of the arbitration were split on a 70% (Claimant) 30% (Respondent) basis.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-claimant-v-respondent-final-award-monday-28th-february-2022

Applicant argued that the anticipated period inserted in the agreement was calculated on the initial proposed rate at which the coal reserve could be mined and processed, rounded off to 8 years (96 months). This was necessary because the standard wording of the FIDIC Gold contract required a time period, rather than a term until the coal reserve is depleted Court found that there was a prima facie case that the contract included a tacit term or by way of interpretation that all the time clauses in the contract relating to operation of the Plant should be read to mean until the depletion of the coal reserves or 96 months, whichever comes first.

The cases of Zillion (see below in table) and Peterborough City Council (see below in table) were considered in this appeal. The parties had a dispute relating to the contract, which had been referred to a Dispute Adjudication Board and then further to arbitration. Namibia Road Products, the Contractor, issued a Notice of Dissatisfaction with the DAB decision and arbitration award and sought to appeal. The Contractor argued (a) that the arbitrator had committed misconduct, and gross irregularity, (b) improper obtaining of the award, and (c) that the award should be set aside. The Contractor argued that the arbitrator had failed to correctly apply the correct principles as decided in Zillion (see below) when drafting the award, and had also failed to consider that The Roads Authority of Namibia (the Employer) owed money to the Contractor. The Employer objected to the appeal and requested punitive costs against the Contractor on grounds that they had acted vexatiously. The court dismissed the appeal, upholding the arbitration award and DAB decision. The court considered that arbitrator misconduct, where bad faith or a failure of natural justice had occurred, was not sufficient grounds to set aside an award, and regardless arbitrator misconduct did not extend to a bona fide mistake in fact or law, as was the case here. The court decided that the Contractor had failed to satisfy the court that any statutory grounds were met to set aside the award, but did grant payment of an owed sum to the Contractor and declined any order on costs.

Velile, the Contractor, filed a claim due to unauthorised variation of the works and non-payment of retention fees. The Municipal Council, the Employer, counterclaimed on the basis that the contractor was overpaid due to insufficient documentation. Clauses 20.2 and 20.4 required disputes to be resolved through a DAB. The parties also entered into a Dispute Adjudication Agreement and appointed an adjudicator. Velile also initiated arbitration, but did not complete the process. Velile argued that the contract had ended and a performance certificate had been issued, rendering the arbitration clause inapplicable. Velile claimed that there was no dispute left to arbitrate. The Employer issued a 'special plea' to the court and maintained that the dispute arose from the original contract, making the arbitration clause valid. They argued that the termination of the contract did not terminate the arbitration agreement relating to disputes arising from the contract. The court upheld the Employer's special plea, ruling that the dispute must be referred to arbitration. The court emphasised the significance of the wishes expressed by the parties when they entered into the agreement; from the start, the parties wished for disputes under the agreement to be dealt with by way of arbitration. The court also considered the fact that Velile had already commenced arbitration proceecdings, and did not consider the Employer not cooperating as justification for skipping over a course already 'set into motion'.",Link,https://namiblii.org/akn/na/judgment/nahcmd/2021/463/eng@2021-10-05

Court held the High Court had no power to compel the parties to submit to arbitration to resolve their disputes. The effect of the high court’s order referring the disputes between the parties to arbitration, was to amend the contract. It was held that Clause 4.2 does not require SANRAL to prove an entitlement under the contract before it can make a demand on the guarantee, on the basis that the purpose of the performance guarantee ‘undoubtedly was to secure SANRAL’s position in the event of a dispute and pending resolution thereof’. Any other construction would render meaningless the indemnity in clause 4.2. A claim on the guarantee is permissible, regardless of disputes under the contract (unconditional).

Jandu, the Contractor, argued that the arbitrator had erred on 18 grounds, the first 5 of which were that: (a) the arbitrator had no jurisdiction; (b) the arbitrator had committed serious errors in law and fact; (c) the arbitrator had incorrectly determined the scope of the contract under dispute; (d) the arbitrator had committed misconduct; and (e) that the experts were not impartial. Some of the other 13 grounds included that the arbitrator had allowed foreign lawyers to practice without proper licenses and failed to follow proper mediation procedures before arbitration as stipulated in the contract. Hodi objected to this petition on the grounds that Jandu's 18 grounds did not constitute errors in the award or arbitrator misconduct, Hodi had never ratified the contract, and this petition should be considered impermissible litigation. The court set aside the award and ordered for re-arbitration with a new arbitrator agreed by the parties. The court considered that the arbitrator had contravened Clause 20.2 of the contract, and that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction due to the absence of a written opinion from the mediator, as required by the contract.

Whilst it was accepted that the contract in its (then) current form was to expire in August 2025, the main application was opposed on the basis that the contract was unenforceable due to a mistake relating to the duration of the contract and the person who signed the contract on behalf of the City lacked the requisite authority to sign a contract which expires in August 2025. Court held that section 33 of the Municipal Finance Management Act 56 of 2003 did not prohibit contracts with a variable termination date. It was further argued that a standard FIDIC contract made provision for the issue of variation orders where there may be a delay in the completion of the Works or if the scope of the Works was to be increased This would invariably push forward the completion date of the project.

The appeal court agreed that Mr Quang was not the legal representative of the defendant. Regarding the interim measures, the appeal court held that the measures were not applied since the dispute had been resolved by the court in accordance with the law and that this was not a basis to set aside the first judgment. The temporary measures related to security on site, and the court held that pursuant to Sub-Clause 10.2, the plaintiff (contractor) was only responsible for maintaining security and order on site during the construction process, which ended when the contract was terminated and the site was handed back to the defendant. As to the merits of the first judgment. The project concerned a commercial and housing complex building. It was the plaintiff's case that 7 phases of construction were completed and all appropriate documents for payment instalments were issued, all in accordance with the regulations, accompanied by value-added invoices, and all documents related to its payment requests and advances were sent to the defendant. The defendant did not make payment to the plaintiff, in breach of its payment obligations. The defendant asserted that this was as a result of poor quality of construction carried out by the plaintiff. Following several requests for payment, and a notice to suspend, the contract was finally terminated pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.2. The plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendant, claiming damages for late payment: (1) payment of the entire amount outstanding, specifically the value of the completed phases 1 – 7 (the 7 instalments less the advance payment) plus interest; and (2) damages caused by termination of the contract, including costs of labour, machinery, equipment and materials on site between the period of suspension until demobilisation. The plaintiff also requested the court to declare that its obligation to pay the performance bond to the defendant was not trigger as a result of the defendant's breach of contract and that the guarantor (Bank D) did not need to fulfil its guaranteed payment obligation in accordance with the letter of guarantee. The court found that the plaintiff validly terminated the contract and that the defendant was liable to pay the entire value of completed works (all 7 instalments) to the plaintiff, on the basis that the acceptance records of the phases all confirmed the quality met the required technical standards. Concerning the performance guarantee, the court noted that pursuant to Sub-Clause 16.2, the plaintiff had the right to terminate the contract due to the defendant's (Employer's) breach of contract. The court further noted that the termination was in accordance with Sub-Clause 16.2, and therefore the obligation to pay the guarantee deed to the defendant, was not triggered",Link,https://congbobanan.toaan.gov.vn/5ta659331t1cvn/KDTMPT_Cong_ty_Long_GiangKhoms.pdf

The Engineers' Board of Kenya commissioned an enquiry, found that the appellants were guilty of professional misconduct having breached certain codes of conduct, and sanctioned the appellants for this breach including removing their names from the relevant professional register. The appellants sought in the High Court to quash the respondent's decisions on various grounds including that: their role on the project was limited, the main construction contract - which was a FIDIC design and build contract - was between other parties and the appellants had no role in that contract, the accident arose because of errors in the sequence of concreting (i.e., errors during construction) by the contractor to the FIDIC contract, plus other procedural grounds. Respondent maintained that the primary cause of the collapse was wrong sequencing of concreting as a result of failure by the appellants to provide adequate design information to the contractor. The High Court upheld the respondent's decision on the basis that judicial review is concerned with the decision making process, not the decision itself or the merits of the decision and that, as long as the process followed by the decision maker is proper, and the decision is within the law, a court will not interfere, and administrative decisions can only be challenged for irregularity, irrationality and procedural impropriety. The Court of Appeal found that the respondent failed the rationality and proportionality tests and held that the judge ought to have quashed the respondent's desicion, which was made on the basis that the design was flawed and on the fact that the appellants had failed to supervise the works. The appeal partially succeeded (the removal of the appellants' names from the register for other procedural grounds was upheld).",Link,http://kenyalaw.org/caselaw/cases/view/203345

The contract had been terminated. The applicant alleged that the arbitrator acted beyond the scope of reference in awarding compound interest which was not provided for as part of the contract. In relying on a non-existent formula to make the award, the arbitrator had re-written the contract. It also contended that the arbitrator had ignored the express provisions of the contract in the calculation of interest and by so doing awarded interest that was injurious to the national and economic interests of Kenya as taxpayer funds would be used to settle the award if it was not set aside. Further, the arbitrator had acted in excess of jurisdiction by awarding a sum for a Variation despite this Variation being rejected by the applicant, by awarding a sum on account of an unpaid certificate which was not certified by the project manager and by awarding a sum for idle time and equipment that was not based on the contract nor supported by the BOQ. The applicant also argued that it should keep the retention money. It also argued that the claim was time barred. The court held that the compounded interest was ‘inordinately high, [did] not constitute compensation but [was] punitive and amounts to unjust enrichment to the extent that if it [was] enforced, would injure the public finances’. The award of such interest was set aside for violation of public policy. Regarding the Variation, the court held that it was a matter within the contract which the arbitrator considered and came to a conclusion. This was contemplated by the parties for determination. The court also held that the uncertified amount was also within the arbitrator’s reference. The arbitrator held that retention money was due to the respondent as the contract was terminated prematurely due to the applicant’s default.

The Supreme Court confirmed that, unless the claiming party can show any of the exceptional circumstances, the court is duty-bound to uphold the integrity of the arbitration process and ensure that the parties do not undermine the process they voluntarily engaged themselves in. Following an instruction to widen the carriageway of the road, and several variation orders, ITD submitted a claim for overrun earthwork quantities. A joint survey was conducted by the parties to evaluate and resolve the claims. KEI advised ITD that its claim for additional compensation on the overrun earthwork quantities could not be allowed. The matter was referred to the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (“CIAC”). DPWH submitted counterclaims against ITD. In its final award, CIAC found that DPWH was liable for ITD’s claim for overrun earthwork quantities (with interest). According to CIAC, ITD’s claims were not barred by waiver, abandonment or estoppel despite its failure to comply with the notice requirement under FIDIC and COPA, on the basis that its non-compliance with the notice requirement is mooted by the express provision under FIDIC which allows claims to be decided under arbitration, even though a party failed to comply with timely notice and submission of contemporary records requirements. Further, DPWH was estopped from raising this issue when it decided to conduct a joint survey to evaluate and resolve the claims. The CIAC also held that there can be no waiver because ITD officially notified KPWH and KEI of its intention to be paid for its claims. Each party was ordered to shoulder their respective legal expenses. The counterclaims were denied DPWH filed a petition for review of the final award, however, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) dismissed the petition and ruled that the CIAC did not err in its ruling. DPWH applied to the Supreme Court (“SC”) for an exception (to the rule that only pure questions of law may be raised) and reversal of the CA decision. The SC held that the findings of the CIAC were final and conclusive and are not reviewable by court save under narrow exceptions. The SC found that none of the exceptional circumstances existed in this case. DPWH’s claim for exception was denied and the CIAC’s arbitral award ruled as final and unappealable and only questionable before court on pure questions of law.",Link,https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2020/jul2020/gr_235853_2020.html
22,2020,Estate Management & Business Development Company Limited v Junior Sammy Contractors Limited TT 2020 CA 31 (29 June 2020),"Court of Appeal, Republic of Trinidad & Tobago",1999 Red,"Following summary judgment (in favour of the claimant) and the dismissal of its application for specific disclosure (see above judgment dated 11 March 2020), the defendant filed its appeal against both decisions as well as an application for stay of execution pending an appeal. This judgment concerns the latter application in which the court was engaged to exercise its discretion to order a stay of execution, whilst recognising the starting principle that a party is not lightly to be deprived of its judgment. The court recognised that giving effect to the overriding objective may warrant a practical common-sense approach in balancing the relative risk of harm to both parties while the appeal is pending. Main question the court had to answer was whether there was a risk of injustice to either of the parties if the stay was granted or refused, and secondly if a stay would be appropriate, what terms or conditions would be appropriate which are also just and proportionate in the circumstances. The court considered the following: (1) whether or not EMBD demonstrated that its appeals have a good prospect of success; (2) that it would be ruined, or its appeal otherwise stifled if forced to pay JS immediately instead of after the (unsuccessful) appeal; and (3) the risks that JS would be unable to enforce the judgment if the stay is granted and EMBD’s appeal fails. The court found that a stay of execution on specific conditions was warranted.",Link,http://webopac.ttlawcourts.org/LibraryJud/Judgments/coa/2020/kokaram/CvA_20_S020DD29jun2020.pdf

The disputes between the parties included delays to the project and poor quality of works, which the contractor failed to remedy, and which led to the plaintiff terminating the contract. A new contractor was engaged to complete the works and carry out the necesary remedial works. The plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendant (contractor) claiming payment for: (1) delay damages; (2) refund of the sum with which the advance payment exceeded the actual construction value; and (3) damages for completion and remedial costs necessary as a result of the defendant's poor quality of works (after deducting the liquidated value of machinery that remained on site). The defendant denied the allegations made against the quality of its work and that the plaintiff did not comply with the Sub-Clause 3.3 notice (to correct) provisions and could, therefore, not hold the defendant liable for the remedial costs of its new contractor. It also asserted that both parties voluntarily agreed to terminate the contract. The defendant further denied liability for delay damages, asserting in the first instance that the plaintiff did not have a valid construction permit, without which none of the progress milestones were valid. In any event, it rejected the plaintiff's interpretation of delay damages calculated at 12% of the value of the contract, and asserted that the contract provided a rate calculated on the contract value of each violated part and not the entire contract value. The court ruled in favor of the claimant, finding the respondent liable on all grounds. On appeal the defendant did not present any new evidence, nor did they attend the appeal hearing. The Supreme Court dismissed the defendant's application and upheld the original judgment in favour of the plaintiff. Notably, during the appeal proceedings the plaintiff corrected its claim for delay damages to comply with the law of Vietnam, i.e., 8% of the value of the breached (delayed) contract – i.e., delayed volume (confirming that currently, under the law of Vietnam, FIDIC delay damages are treated as a penalty and are therefore capped).",Link,https://congbobanan.toaan.gov.vn/5ta524117t1cvn/296_13_5_AnPhathanh_CongtySaigonNhaTrang.pdf

Following a dispute between the parties, the plaintiffs commenced arbitration proceedings with the VIAC. The defendant challenged the jurisdiction of the tribunal, arguing: (1) that the plaintiffs commenced arbitration under Sub-Clause 20.6 prematurely, i.e., without following the mandatory DAB and amicable settlement procedures required pursuant to Sub-Clauses 20.2 – 20.5; and (2) that the arbitration agreement only selected the procedural rules of the VIAC and Vietnam as the place of arbitration, and did not specifically refer to it as the administering institution. The plaintiffs asserted that they had no choice but to refer the dispute directly to arbitration on the basis that: (1) the respondent unilaterally took measures to recover certain provisional payments, which caused financial damage to the plaintiffs; and (2) that the parties had at that point been engaged in discussions for over two years in an attempt to settle, and the DAB and amicable settlement procedures, therefore, would only have prolonged the dispute. The VIAC denied the defendant's jurisdiction challenge. The court agreed with the VIAC's decision and rejected the defendant's application. The court found that reference to the VIAC rules was sufficient to demonstrate the parties' intention and choice of the VIAC as the administering institution. As to the validity of the arbitration agreement, that was considered with reference to the Law on Commercial Arbitration (LCA). The court noted that non-compliance with pre-arbitration procedures was not listed as a legal ground under the LCA. The court further held that commencing arbitration without engaging in DAB and amicable settlement procedures were not inconsistent with the agreed dispute resolution mechanisms, also in light of the fact that the dispute remained unresolved despite extensive correspondence between the parties for a period of over 2 years.",Link,https://congbobanan.toaan.gov.vn/2ta485230t1cvn/chi-tiet-ban-an

The defendant raised three defences: (1) due to the assignment of all their receivables under the contract to a third party, the latter was the only party with the right to institute proceedings; (2) the IPCs were incorrect and allegedly could be re-opened; and (2) the defendant had not been able to conclude its analysis of the IPCs since it was awaiting specific disclosure of documents.

Eventually, AATT was advised to commence arbitration proceedings to preserve its position. JPL responded by denying liability for most of the defective works and refused to accept the appointment of an arbitrator. JPL argued that 1) there was an inordinate delay in commencing arbitration, 2) the dispute had not yet crystallised, 3) the Engineer had not been properly replaced and so the determination was not valid and 4) a valid Engineer's determination is a pre-requisite to commencing arbitration. Held: 1) Due to the negotiations, and the apparent good faith of JPL, the delay was not inordinate - AATT believed things could be resolved amicably. 2) The dispute had clearly crystallised, as JPL had denied liability for defects AATT was seeking rectification for. 3) AATT had not given the requisite notice in order to replace the Engineer, and JPL had refuted its appointment. However, the Court noted that consent must not be reasonably withheld, and obiter stated that in this case, it appeared that JPL would have refused consent to any engineer, as it would not want AATT to get an engineer's determination as preparation for arbitration, and so hinted that this would likely be a situation in which consent was unreasonably withheld. 4) An engineer's determination is not a pre-requisite to commencing arbitration.",Link,http://webopac.ttlawcourts.org/LibraryJud/Judgments/HC/aboud/2018/cv_18_02353DD17feb2020.pdf

The case concerns construction of a hydropower plant project. The contractor (claimant) terminated the contract on the basis of delays and escalated costs, and following disagreement with the employer (respondent) on sums owning to the claimant, the latter referred the dispute to arbitration and was granted an award in its favour. The respondent filed a request to this court to set aside the award, on three grounds: (1) the tribunal's decision to change the hearing venue, thus outside of the parties' agreement; (2) the tribunal's failure to take into consideration the respondent's factual witness evidence pursuant to the IBA Rules, in violation of the arbitral procedures; and (3) tribunal was said to have failed to make its own assessment of the quantum of damages, instead it was alleged that the tribunal relied solely on the expert evidence produced by the claimants. Regarding the first ground, the court noted that the parties agreed Hanoi as the place of arbitration, as recorded in the tribunal's procedural order. However, during the course of the proceedings, the tribunal granted certain interim relief against the respondent. The respondent instituted proceedings in the Hanoi Court against the tribunal in their personal capacity, which was followed by (and the reason for) the tribunal's decision to use its discretion to change the location of the hearing to Osaka in Singapore. The court held that a change departing from the parties' agreement was sufficient to warrant setting aside the award. The second ground. Whilst the respondent filed factual witness evidence, those witnesses were not present at the hearing, and the respondent decided not to participate in the hearing. The tribunal viewed this as a general lack of cooperation in the arbitration and decided to not attach any weight to the factual witness statements. The court held that the tribunal had violated Article 56.2 of the Law on Commercial Arbitration (LCA), to settle the dispute on available documents and evidence, and by not taking into account the respondent's evidence and its application of the IBA Rules, the tribunal adversely affected the respondent's interest.

The requesting party contended that the award violated local laws, and that the VIAC (Vietnam International Arbitration Council) lacked jurisdiction on the basis that the parties failed to comply with the requirement to pursue amicable settlement pursuant to Sub-Clause 20. 5, instead the dispute was referred directly for arbitration (under Sub-Clause 20.6). They further asserted that the tribunal's decision relating to the cost of scaffolding fell outside the scope of contract, i.e., formed a completely separate agreement, and therefore outside of the tribunal's jurisdiction. It was further contended that the tribunal's decision regarding payment of a retained warranty (pursuant to Sub-Clauses 1.1.3.10 and 10.1) was wrong on the basis that the project was not eligible for actual completion since certain legally required tests had not been completed, and the decision was therefore not in accordance with the law. The related party opposed the application on the basis that parties deleted Sub-Clause 20.2 and 20.3 relating to DRB proceedings, and asserted that the requirement for amicable settlement pursuant to Sub-Clause 20.5 was only applicable following DRB proceedings and a decision under Sub- Clause 20.4. Accordingly, Sub-Clause 20.5 was not applicable, and the parties had the right to refer disputes directly for arbitration.

The court agreed. The court confirmed that pursuant to Sub-Clauses 20.8, the amicable settlement requirement in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.5 was only mandatory in cases where Sub-Clauses 20.2 – 20.4 were applicable. On procedural grounds, the court found that the requesting party's application failed. The issues regarding the warranty were said to fall within the content of the dispute and not within the scope when considering an application to set aside an arbitral award as this court would not entertain a re-trial as the dispute had already been resolved.

A dispute arose regarding payments for the work done, which was then referred to a DAB. The DAB largely confirmed the valuation, after which Euroget issued a Notice of Dissatisfaction (NOD) with the DAB's decision. Tieso sought to enforce the DAB's decision as a final judgment. The High Court and the Court of Appeal both rejected this, ruling that the DAB's decision was not a final arbitral award and that the NOD triggered the next stage of dispute resolution: international arbitration. Tieso appealed these decisions to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed that the DAB process was not an arbitration; the ""FIDIC Rules"" explicitly stated that the DAB was not acting as arbitrators. The Court held that the DAB decision was not final and binding, as Euroget had issued a valid NOD as per the contract.

However, for the purposes of this table, the case is considered instructive in relation to time limits for adjudicator decisions. Following a dispute between the parties an adjudicator was appointed. The adjudicator’s determination was due after an exchange of documents between the parties and within four weeks of the end of the period of received information (which was 29 June 2018). The adjudicator requested an extension of time for his decision (which was due 27 July 2018). This was refused by Transnet but agreed by Group Five. Even though both parties had not consented, the adjudicator continued with the adjudication and finally published his determination on 18 September 2018. Group Five applied to the High Court for an order to give effect to the adjudicator’s determination. Transnet resisted. The court found that the contract failed to stipulate what would happen if the parties failed to agree to an extension and considered that the requirement for parties’ consent was to give them some control over the process. The court held that the adjudicator was not competent to proceed beyond the initial deadline in the absence of both parties’ consent and, accordingly, the determination was late, in breach of the terms of the contract, and was not binding or enforceable.",Link,http://www.saflii.org.za/za/cases/ZAGPJHC/2019/328.html

Zillion submitted an NOD after the DAB's decision and did not pay as ordered Salz-Gossow brought a court application seeking implementation of the DAB's decision. Zillion opposed this application on the basis that the NOD suspended the operation of DAB's decision. Zillion argued that the Court should not exercise its discretion to order Specific Performance. Zillion brought a counter application to the Court to set aside the DAB's decision as the main relief. CFI Held: The Court granted Salz-Gossow's application finding that, pending the arbitration, the ruling of the DAB needed to be complied with and that there was no reason why specific performance should not be granted as contemplated in the agreement. The Court made an Order for the amount to be paid to the Salz-Gossow and dismissed the counter application of Zillion. Zillion appealed the decision of the High Court. The Appeal was for the invalidity of the DAB decision on the following grounds: 1) Zillion could not afford the amount determined and, as the contentions were more legal than factual, the Court should assume jurisdiction; and 2) as to the awarded interest amount in the DAB's decision - applying the 'Reasonable Man' test, the decision was 'unreasonable, improper, irregular and wrong, leading to 'patently inequitable' result and 'unjust evaluation' and should be set aside. SC Held: Zillion's financial position was such that it had never been unable to pay the amount determined by the DAB. For the purpose of the application to stay, Zillion attempted to make out a case that raising finance to pay the amount determined by the DAB would prejudice them in the project, whereas the real prejudice would be that they would not be able to recoup the amount from Salz-Gossow, should they be successful in the arbitration proceedings. The SC upheld the DAB decision.",Link,https://namiblii.org/na/judgment/supreme-court/2019/10

The point of appeal was related to the validity of a contractual notice. MCSJV subcontracted with Bauer. During the course of the work, unforeseeable ground conditions were established and Bauer had to do additional excavation. Bauer, having experienced difficulties with the ground conditions, proceeded with the extra work required without securing an instruction first. Later, Bauer gave notice of its loss and expense entitlement, referring specifically to the variation, being the additional excavation. In its notice, It did not refer to an entitlement arising under the ground conditions provision. Disputes arose and the matter was referred to arbitration. Bauer submitted its claim on two alternative bases: both as a variation and as a ground conditions claim. AT observed that the circumstances gave rise to a valid ground conditions claim but there was no notice issued to the Engineer, describing the ground conditions and reasons why they should be considered unforeseeable. Bauer had not given notice under clause 21 of his contract by reference to the event (similar to the requirements of Clause 4.12.1 of FIDIC Red 2017 [Contractor's Notice] and increase in cost of the execution of the works. Considering the facts, AT said that it had no entitlement to be paid as a variation because no instruction had been issued, however decided that the notice Bauer had given was equally valid as a notice based on unforeseen ground conditions and that fact that Bauer had made its claim on the basis of a Variation did not preclude it from making a claim on a new legal basis. The costs awarded by the AT included the standby costs of plant and equipment MCSJV appealed the AT's second interim award on points of law and claimed that the AT had included sums in the evaluation that had not actually been incurred by Bauer. Held: The AT's conclusion failed to give effect to the express wording of Clause 21 (similar to clause 4.12.1 FIDIC 2017) and that the AT did not misdirect itself in regards to awarded costs as it had received and considered evidence before making its valuation of a fair and reasonable price.",Link,https://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2019/916.html
25,2019,"Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) v. Roguza Development Corporation, GR No. 199705, 3 April 2019","Supreme Court Philippines, Baguio",Not specified,Appeal against lower court decisions concerning an arbitral award issued in respect of a dispute about a road rehabilitation project. The project was commenced but suspended because of right of way problems. The suspension lasted 32 months meaning that the project completed late. The contractor made monetary claims under the contract regarding this suspension. The contractor argued that it was constrained to accept payment from the employer of a lower amount than claimed because of financial distress it was suffering which was aggravated by the length of time that had elapsed since the claim was made and the employer made its offer. The contractor commenced arbitral proceedings for the original claimed amount. The arbitral tribunal found the that contractor had established that it was in financial distress at the time the employer offered to pay the reduced amount and that it was constrained to accept the offer (the 'letter-waiver') to facilitate payment. The arbitral tribunal declared the 'letter-waiver' to be 'inefficacious' and awarded the contractor some of the additional sums claimed. There followed numerous conflicting court decisions regarding the arbitral award. The Supreme Court noted that the existence of conflicting decisions appeared to result from failure by the contractor's counsel to disclose the identity of the parties and issues in two of the court cases. The Supreme Court found that elements of res judicata existed and granted the appeal against certain of the lower court decisions.,Link,https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2019/apr2019/gr_199705_2019.html

Eventually ASJV delivered a notice of termination for having been prevented from executing the works for a continuous period of 84 days by reason of force majeure. ASJV also requested that SANRAL undertake not to make a demand on the PG without giving 14 days notice as they were only allowed to make a demand under the provisions of Clause 4.2 of the Contract. SANRAL disputed ASJV's right to terminate the contract and did not agree that the protests constituted force majeure. It also argued that it was the law that the PG must be paid and the parties may consider entitlement at a later stage.

The Respondent (China Wu Yi Limited) subcontracted with Machira Limited (the Claimant in this case). Upon completion of the works, China Wu Yi Limited issued the statement of final account for evaluation to the Engineer, who verified and certified the same. The certificate was then forwarded to the Applicant to settle. The Applicant claimed that during the preparation of the statement of final account the Contractor excluded the work done by subcontractor Machira. Machira then issued court proceedings against China Wu Yi for recovery of the unpaid sums. China Wu Yi was granted leave to issue a Third Party Notice against KNHA. KNHA argued that it only became aware of the dispute upon being served with the pleadings and argued further that the Machira suit against China Wu Yi was premature for failure to exhaust all available dispute resolution mechanisms in the contract. KNHA asserted that clause 67 (Settlement of Disputes) of the contract executed between China Wu Yi and KNHA provided an elaborate dispute resolution mechanism whereby disputes between China Wu Yi and KNHA were to be referred to the Engineer in the first instance. Furthermore, KNHA contended that China Wu Yi failed to adhere to the mandatory statutory provisions to serve KNHA with one month’s notice outlining its claim. Finally, KNHA submitted that China Wu Yi's claim was statute barred since an action against KNHA had to be instituted within twelve months after the default complained of. KNHA therefore applied to stay the proceedings, subject to arbitration. Held: China Wu Yi's claim was not statute barred KNHA could not use a Preliminary objection to stay the proceedings and the Court declined to stay the proceedings.",Link,http://kenyalaw.org/caselaw/cases/view/162630

Two of them were secured by a Performance Guarantee (PG) and recovered through the IPC mechanism. The 3rd AP was unsecured. The Main Contractor issued a demand to the bank. The Subcontractor brought an urgent application seeking an order stopping the bank from making the payment. As the PG was unconditional, the only ground on which the bank could deny the call was fraud. The Subcontractor therefore claimed that the bond was called fraudulently. It claimed that the Main Contractor had recovered the entire amount of the APs secured by the PG. It conceded that the outstanding amount was not secured and should be treated as a loan as it was a transaction entirely separate from the building contract, to be recouped through either the certification process or through the Final Account. Held: The Court found in favour of the Main Contractor because: 1) The IPC made no distinction between secured and unsecured PGs in the section ""Repayment of Advance Payments"" thus indicating that the Parties treated all Advance Payments as made under the Contract and not outside and 2) The Claimant did not put forward any evidence to prove an agreement that the outstanding amount was to be treated as an unsecured loan.",Link,http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPJHC/2018/569.html#_ftn12

The contract was based on FIDIC with amended Clause 20.6 in the PCC. There were some discussions and suggestions between the parties about the Rules and Seat of Arbitration, which were not reflected in the signed contract. The contract was terminated by Sinolanka on the ground that Interna failed to furnish a performance guarantee as required under the contract. By this time, Interna had completed a portion of the contracted works and had incurred significant expenditure in relation to such works. Interna referred the dispute to ICC arbitration. Sinolanka raised objections to the jurisdiction of the tribunal arguing that the parties had not agreed to ICC arbitration and that an alternative Sri Lankan arbitration clause was applicable as Interna had made its offer to contract on the basis of that clause and it had been accepted when the parties signed the Contract.

It was therefore evident that the Certificate for payment was a pertinent and central issue of dispute between the parties, which raised a triable issue preventing the court from entering Judgment on Admission. After dismissing that application, the Judge ordered the dispute to be referred to Arbitration. On the basis that it was clear that the alleged indebtedness by the Garnishee was contested and yet to be proved, and that the Arbitral Proceedings were yet to be concluded the court in this application held that it would be premature and futile to make an order attaching a debt which is still disputed and the subject of Arbitral Proceedings.

The Respondent (Kampala) objected to the payable figures outlined in the Final Certificate due to alleged performance shortfall on the part of the Claimant. The Respondent unilaterally reviewed the certificates before issuing a final certificate with a reduced outstanding payment. Establishing which set of certificates was legally enforceable formed the heart of this case. Held: The court ruled in favour of the Claimant, finding the Respondent's claims to be substantially impaired on several grounds. The Respondent's unilateral amendment of the Final Certificate did not accord with the GCC and it was not delivered to the Claimant, nor agreed to in writing. In principal the issuing of final certificates creates a liquid debt – discrepancies ought to have been raised prior to certification and resolved by adjudication or arbitration as per the parties’ agreement. Failing this, the court found that the set-off sought ought to have been raised in the current suit via counterclaim and not through unilateral adjustment of the final certificate. The Respondent was found further to have misrepresented the Final Certificate of Completion to the Claimant, following the Project Manager's issue, and consequently was estopped from raising the erroneous conduct of its project manager as a justification for its non-payment.

The Claimants' primary case related to alleged failures by Respondent to provide accurate and reliable geotechnical data and an alleged withholding of crucial geotechnical information in connection with the design and construction of the main cofferdam and the feasibility of a diversion of the Cocoli River. According to Claimants, these failures were breaches by Respondent of certain duties and it led to Claimants entering in the contract under financial terms that were more advantageous to Respondent than Claimants would have agreed to had Respondent provided all infromation and performed its duties at tender stage. Claimants therefore sought extensions of time and damages. Alternatively, Claimants sought compensation for unforseeable physical conditions. Respondent's position was that the allocation of risk and responsibility of physical conditions is common in construction and engineering contract and, in a design and build contract, since it is the contractor that must come up with a design suitable for the physical conditions, it is logical that the risk of such design should remain with the contractor. The contract provides for the party's agreement as to the risk of unexpected physical conditions including agreement as to the claims a contractor may claim in defined parts of the site. Also, geotechnical information was provided. The parties agreed that the contract was an administrative contract but disagreed about many aspects of Panamanian law which were considered at length by the tribunal. There was a dissenting opinion from one of the arbitrators in respect of certain issues, including the principle of good faith.

31,2015,Kisii County Government v Masosa Construction Company Ltd [2015] eKLR,"Court of Appeal of Kenya, Kisumu",1987 Red 4th ed,"The Appellant (Employer) entered into two contracts with the Respondent (Contractor). The first contract was completed and the second was 'abandoned' following mobilisation. The contractor claimed that Employer remained indebted to it under the first contract and, under the second, that a commitment fee that ought to have been paid was not paid and following “the termination and or abatement of the second contract” its submitted contractual claim was certified. The Employer denied the claim as being time-barred, asserted that the Contractor had not complied with the terms of the contract and claimed entitlement to LADs. The High Court found that the Employer had admitted the debt and that the claim was not time-barred as the cause of action was the Employer's statement two years later that it was not going to pay the outstanding amount. The Employer appealed under Clause 48.3. It asserted that the Contractor should have demonstrated that it had completed the works under the contract by producing a “Taking-Over Certificate” issued by the Engineer to show substantial and satisfactory completion of the works under the Contract. Also that no evidence was presented before the trial court demonstrating compliance with Clause 60 requiring the Contractor to submit to the Engineer on a monthly basis valuations of work done for certification to facilitate issuance of payment certificates on the basis of which payments would then be made. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge was wrong and the cause of action rightly accrued upon the issuance of the Final Payment Certificate, however the Limitations of Actions Act did apply as the Employer was a local authority. In conclusion, the Court held that it was unnecessary to establish the claim beyond the Employer's admission of the debt.",Link,http://kenyalaw.org/caselaw/cases/view/116519

The Contractor (S.C. ""H.""; S.A.), contested the Employer's (S.C. ""G.C.""; S.A.) application of two separate 10% retentions from an interim payment certificate. The Contractor argued that these retentions were applied cumulatively and incorrectly, claiming they represented the same thing, which was essentially a performance guarantee. The Employer maintained that the two 10% retentions were distinct, serving different purposes and having different due dates for payment. The Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's decision, ruling that the two 10% retentions were indeed distinct. The court found that: one 10% retention (under clause 14.3) served as a guarantee for the conformity of the works, to cover potential claims for defects; the other 10% retention (under volume 4, section 1, article 1.4 of the contract) was related to the ""settlement method"" of the works, with payment deferred until after the issuance of the Acceptance Report upon completion of all works. The court determined that the two retentions had different purposes and different due dates for their release. Therefore, the Employer's application of both retentions was deemed correct.

Claimant was the successful bidder and received the Final Letter of Award. Claimant asserted that, before the contract was signed, Respondent modified the contract to include only five towns rather than eight. By that time, Claimant had already carried out surveys of the eight towns. The contract was formalized and the signed Financial Agreement stipulated the date of Site possession by the Contractor and the requirement of a Letter of Guarantee. However, the Letter of Guarantee was not submitted by Respondent to Claimant. As such, Claimant terminated the Contract and sought to obtain reparation by recourse to arbitration. The Claimant claimed entitlement for: 1) Lost Profit - Claimant asserted that when it won the tender, Respondent had accepted Claimant’s gross profit as it was the most competitive. 2) Claimant claimed consequential damages based on Respondent’s failure to provide the payment guarantee, which caused Claimant's financier to withdraw from the South Sudan market. As a result, Claimant lost a potential contract where it was expected to realise a substantial profit. Held: The Republic of South Sudan had breached its obligation under the Contract. As a result of this breach, Claimant was entitled to terminate the Contract and to damages plus interest. In ordering damages, the Tribunal sought to restore Claimant’s position to what it would have been had the contract been performed. The AT concluded that Claimant was entitled to 'lost profits' net of tax. The Tribunal found that Claimant was entitled to a 25% profit margin for the net loss of profit. The AT also found that Claimant had shown extensive evidence of the sums incurred in expectation of the contract’s performance and that Respondent was aware of their activities. As such, the AT ordered Respondent to pay the Contractor's direct damages and indirect costs.

SCMASA claimed that they: had the right to receive payment directly for the works executed; had acted as part of the association and JAOP signed the contract both in its own name and as SCMASA's agent; and therefore SCMASA should be considered a party to the contract and not merely a subcontractor. The Employer contended that payment should only be made to the head of the consortium, JAOP, as stipulated in the association agreement, and asserted that SCMASA did not meet the procedural standard to claim payments directly from the contract, since the agreement specified that payments could only be made to the leader of the consortium. The court found that the association agreement and the terms of the public procurement contract did not grant SCMASA the right to claim payments directly and that only JAOP, as the contract's signatory, met the procedural standard to claim payments, and that there was no shared identity between SCMASA and the entity to whom the payment obligation was owed by the respondent.

The original contract between the Ministry of Public Finance - Payment and Contracting Office (MFP-OPCP) (the Employer) and T.E. S.p.A.

The Contractor initiated arbitration proceedings and the tribunal decided in favour of the Contractor. The Employer filed an annulment action against the arbitral award, requesting partial annulment of the award and dismissal of the Contractor's claims. However, as the Employer failed to take any action (i.e. make submissions or submit evidence) for over six months after the annulment action was filed, the Bucharest Court of Appeal ruled the annulment action as expired. The claimant in this case, the Ministry of European Funds, appealed to the ICCJ, arguing for a one-year limitation period based on recent legislative changes. The ICCJ considered the appeal unfounded, and ruled that the applicable limitation period was six months, and not a year, since the arbitration process started under the old Code of Civil Procedure in 2010.

Held: 1) The court declined an injunction with respect to assigning the contract to others and applied Cetelem v Roust Holdings, stating that the purpose of interim measures or injunctions was to preserve an asset and evidence. The contract between the Employer and Contractor could not be deemed an asset, tangible or otherwise and 'restraining the Respondent from assigning the contract to other parties would amount to this court rewriting the contract, something a court would not have jurisdiction or power to do...' 2) The court granted an injunction on the balance of convenience in respect of confiscation etc. of plant, equipment and machinery as these were 'items that were capable of being dissipated if not preserved' The court found that it would be just, equitable, proper and fair to grant an injunction as an interim measure of protection, pending the referral of the dispute to the AT for its determination in line with the provisions of clause 67.",Link,http://kenyalaw.org/caselaw/cases/view/101869

33,2014,M/S National Highways Authority v M/S Hcc Ltd,"High Court of Delhi, India",Red 4th ed (Year not specified),The contract between the parties was based on FIDIC with conditions of particular application. A dispute arose between the parties as to additional sums claimed by the Contractor. The dispute was referred to the DRB but the DRB failed to issue its recommendation within the allowable time period. The dispute was therefore referred to arbitration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Contractor. The Employer applied to the Court seeking to set aside the Arbitral Tribunal's award. The Court considered a few issues: a) whether profit was recoverable by the contract? and b) whether the definition of 'costs' is wide enough to encompass the other charges connected with the delay caused?,Link,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/142262332/
33,2014,Decision 4A_124/2014 (7 July 2014),Swiss Federal Tribunal,1999 (Colour not specified),"Judgment of an appeal for an annulment of a partial award in which the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction to hear a case under Clause 20, despite DAB proceedings not having been instituted. The court had to consider whether or not DAB proceedings (under Clause 20) are a condition precedent for referring a dispute to arbitration. The court disagreed with the Tribunal and found that the use of the word ""shall"" in Sub-Clause 20.2 created an obligation rather than an option. This was supported by the use of the word ""may"" under Sub-Clause 20.4, which did not qualify as a condition precedent. The court, however, accepted certain exceptions to the precondition, i.e., under the principle of good faith, Sub-Clause 20.8 and that the purpose of the DAB (permanent not ad hoc) was to allow for an efficient resolution of disputes in a manner that would not put the works into jeopardy. However, the court held that given the particular circumstances before it, it could not be said that the Tribunal's jurisdiction was affected In particular, there was an ad hoc DAB the constitution of which there was no agreed time limit, and the implementation of which was done only after the works were completed thus effectively akin to a tribunal of first instance on the basis that the parties' positions were arguably already irreconcilable. There could, therefore, not be said that the implementation was absolutely necessary given the economy of the system. Moreover, the procedure was instituted 15 months before the Respondent filed its request for arbitration which is five times longer than the 84 days within which the DAB procedure normally runs and the Respondent tried on several occasions to restart it without the cooperation of the Appellant. Finally, the court noted that Sub-Clause 20.2 requires the parties to enter into a DAA and that pursuant to Clause 2, the DAA only comes into force when its signed by both parties and all members of the DAB. Failing this or when a party refuses to sign the DAA, the recourse available to the other party is to go to arbitration directly in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.8. The court, therefore, held that as a result of the parties having failed to sign a DAA it cannot be said that the DAB was in place when the arbitration was initiated Further, given that there is no clause with which the Appellant could have been compelled to sign the DAA, the Respondent could not be criticised for skipping the DAB phase despite its mandatory nature in order to refer the dispute to arbitration. The appeal was rejected with costs.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-claimant-v-respondent-decision-of-the-swiss-federal-tribunal-4a-124-2014-monday-7th-july-2014
33,2014,"Decision of the Swiss Federal Tribunal 4A_124/2014, 7 July 2014",Swiss Supreme Court,1999 Red 4th ed,"The Contractor notified the Employer of its intention to refer the dispute to the DAB. The constitution of the DAB was delayed and, when finally appointed, the DAA (as per 20.2) was not executed. Later the Contractor filed for arbitration with the ICC. Alongside the arbitral proceedings, the parties continued their exchanges as to the constitution of the DAB. 2 months after filing, the DAB chairperson circulated a draft DAA, the Employer proposed some changes to it and passed it to the Contractor for signature. The Contractor stated that it had commenced arbitration because of the fact that the DAB was still not formally in place 18 months after the start of the contract. The Employer challenged the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis that the Contractor had failed to comply with the DAB procedure. The parties agreed to bifurcate the proceedings and obtain an interim award on the Employer's jurisdictional point. The Tribunal upheld its jurisdiction. It held that as per clause 20 the DAB procedure was only optional and non-mandatory because - 1) the term 'shall' in 20.2 must not be read in isolation but in the broader context of the dispute resolution mechanism instituted by Clause 20 and the use of the term 'may' in 20.4 indicated that the DAB was only optional. This interpretation is supported by Sub-Clause 20.4, §6, 2nd sentence, which mentions two exceptions to the principle that no party can introduce an arbitration request without tendering a notice of dissatisfaction to the other after receiving the DAB decision, 2) Clause 20.8 permitted the parties to resort to Arbitration where one party had attempted to resolve a dispute through the DAB, but no DAB was in place and 3) the fact that the FIDIC conditions did not include a deadline within which the DAB was to be consulted which further supported the argument that the DAB procedure was optional. Following issue of the Interim Award, the Employer filed request with other Swiss Courts to set aside the interim award for lack of jurisdiction. Held: The DAB procedure was a mandatory pre-arbitral step, however according to clause 2, the DAA comes into force when the principal, the contractor and all members of the DAB have signed it. Failing this, legal writing considers that there is no validly constituted DAB and that the only remedy a party has when faced with the refusal of the other party to sign the DAA is to go direct to arbitration pursuant to Sub-Clause 20.8 (Baker, Mellors, Chalmers and Lavers, op. cit., p. 520, n. 9.71).",Link,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/decision/en-claimant-v-respondent-decision-of-the-swiss-federal-tribunal-4a-124-2014-monday-7th-july-2014
33,2014,ICC Final Award in Case 19581,An Eastern European Capital,1999 Red,"(1) The Arbitral Tribunal held that a Claimant is not required to give notice to the Engineer and await its determination under Sub-clause 3.5 before referring a dispute to arbitration if reference to Sub-clause 3.5 is not explicitly provided for in the Contract. The claims in question involved Sub- clauses 4.2, 11.9 and 14.9 regarding performance bonds, performance certificates and retention money, respectively, none of which refer to Sub-clause 3.5. Sub-clause 3.5 only applies when the relevant Sub-clause so provides and Sub-clause 20.1 only applies to extensions of time or additional payments. The return of a retention money guarantee does not constitute consideration given in exchange for works, therefore it is not “additional payment”. Also, compensation for damages and reimbursement of expenses is also outside of Sub-clause 20.1 because they do not constitute consideration in exchange for works. (2) The Arbitral Tribunal also held that the term “or otherwise” in Sub-clause 20.8 which provides a reason for a DAB not to be in place is triggered when the DAB lacks independence or impartiality.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/publication/en-final-award-in-case-19581-extract

The wording is not: “is or will be delayed whichever is the earliest” . Therefore, notice does not have to be given for the purpose of Clause 20.1 until there is actually delay although the Contractor may give notice with impunity when it reasonably believes that it will be delayed",Link,http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2014/1028.html

However, the Claimant had served timely NoDs on other issues from the same DAB decision. Therefore the Arbitral Tribunal held that it was not prevented from examining the issues subject of the Respondent's NoDs because Sub-clause 20.4 refers to disputes and it is the dispute which defines the scope of the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction, not the NoD. The question is then whether a particular issue is relevant to the dispute, in which case, it falls within the jurisdiction. The Arbitral Tribunal also held in obiter dictum that even if the final Contract Price increases between the Claim and the Arbitration or the percentage of delay damages amounts to more than the 5%, it would be the same claim and dispute between the parties so that the increase would not have to be referred to a DAB before reaching Arbitration.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/publication/en-final-award-in-case-19346-extract

34,2014,ICC Final Award in Case 18320,An Eastern European Capital,1999 Yellow,"(1) Whether a Notice of Dissatisfaction (NoD) needs to set out the reasons of the dissatisfaction. The Respondent had identified the letter as a Sub-clause 20.4 NoD and listed out the matters in dispute but did not include the reasons of the dissatisfaction. The Arbitral Tribunal held that the reasons were not necessary for the notice to be compliant. Sub-clauses 20.4 and 20.7 do not provide that failing to set out the reasons renders the notice void or non-existent. The notice must be “expressly defined or at least unambiguously identifiable as such”, i.e., be titled Notice of Dissatisfaction under Sub-clause 20.4 and identify the claims the party wishes to bring to Arbitration. The Arbitral Tribunal also held in obiter that even the party who did not submit a NoD may rely on it to raise the dispute to Arbitration. (2) Whether the Arbitral Tribunal can order the Respondent to comply with Sub-clause 20.4 and pay a binding DAB decision without looking at the merits of the dispute. The Arbitral Tribunal held that, whereas the binding effect of a DAB decision is not lost when a NoD is served, if any of the parties dispute the decision during the Arbitration, it cannot be given effect without considering the merits. However, the binding nature of the decision means the affected party may request contractual or legal remedies for failure to comply or even the provisional performance of the decision by way of an interim award or measure.",Link*,https://jusmundi.com/en/document/publication/en-final-award-in-case-18320-extract

Spilg J held that he found the wording of the relevant contractual provisions to be clear and that their effect is that whilst the DAB decision is not final “the obligation to make payment or otherwise perform under it is…” (at para 12 of the judgment). The court found the key to comprehending the intention and purpose of the DAB process to be the fact that neither payment nor performance can be withheld when the parties are in dispute: “the DAB process ensures that the quid pro quo for continued performance of the contractor’s obligations even if dissatisfied with the DAB decision which it is required to give effect to is the employer’s obligation to make payment in terms of a DAB decision and that there will be a final reconciliation should either party be dissatisfied with the DAB decision…” The court further held at para 14 that the respondent was not entitled to withhold payment of the amount determined by the adjudicator and that he “is precluded by the terms of the provisions of clause 20 (and in particular clauses 20.4 and 20.6) from doing so pending the outcome of the Arbitration.”",Link,https://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPJHC/2013/249.html

The contract in question was the performance security itself, not the construction contract. The Respondent argued that prior to making a demand on the performance security on the basis of any of the grounds in Sub-Clause 4.2(a) to (d), the Claimant was required to serve notice under Sub-Clause 2.5. The performance security incorporated the grounds under Sub-Clause 4.2(a) to (d) by reference. The Court decided that the performance security was an on demand bond and its interpretation relied on the bond itself, not the construction contract necessarily. On the basis of this bond the Claimant was not required to serve a Sub-Clause 2.5 notice in order to make a call, i.e., the Sub-Clause 2.5 notice is not a requirement under the on demand bond. The only relevant notice under Sub-Clause 4.2(d) is a Sub-Clause 15.2 termination notice. However, Sub-Clause 4.2(d) expressly allows calling the bond on the basis of Sub-Clause 15.2 grounds irrespective of whether the termination notice has been given. The Court also recognised that Sub-Clause 4.2(b) refers to a Sub-Clause 2.5 notice. However, reference to the notice is not tantamount to a requirement that a Sub-Clause 2.5 notice is given in order to trigger Sub-Clause 4.2 and allow the Employer to call on the bond without breaching the construction contract.",Link,http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2013/101.pdf

The Arbitral Tribunal decided that (1) a fresh dispute was not necessary since one already existed when the Contractor disagreed with the Project Manager's decision, the Contract was clear in that each party would have a dispute at the moment it disagreed with the Adjudicator's decision and the provision referred to referral from date of written decision, not the dispute; and (2) the purpose of a fixed period is prompt settlement of disputes and certainty, therefore, the clauses are interpreted so that referral of the decision to Arbitration under ICC rules means filing of a Request for Arbitration within the requisite time.

36,2013,"KSC International Ltd. (previously Kundan Singh Construction Ltd.) v Tanzania National Roads Agency, Svea Court of Appeal [Hovrätt], 3 May 2013, Case No. T 3735-12","Svea Court of Appeal, Sweden",Not specified,"The Claimant (Contractor) entered into a contract with the Respondent - Tanzania National Roads Agency (TNRA). The applicable law was Tanzanian law. The Engineer failed to issue an Interim Payment Certificates (IPC). A dispute arose mainly as to whether the Respondent was responsible for certain delays and whether, consequently, the Claimant was entitled to recover damages. The Claimant sent a referral to the DAB and terminated the Contract without waiting for the DAB's decision. Later, dissatisfied with the DAB's decision, the Claimant filed for arbitration. During the Arbitration, the parties agreed to waive the requirement to bring disputes before the DAB prior to referring them to arbitration. The Engineer's relationship with the Respondent (TNRA) was also an issue. To determine this relationship, the arbitral tribunal first examined the relationship between English law and Tanzanian law, as both parties had referred to a number of English court decisions. The AT Decided: A condition for termination of the contract was lacking because the Claimant had not waited for the DAB's decision and the Claimant was ordered to pay a considerable sum to the Respondent. On the Engineer's relationship with TNRA, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the Engineer did not represent the Respondent (TNRA) and that, consequently, the Engineer's failure to issue the IPC could not be attributed to the Respondent (TNRA). The Contractor filed a challenge of the Award arguing that the AT had exceeded its mandate and committed a procedural error as it failed to apply the parties' choice of applicable law. Held: If an arbitral tribunal committed an error in its interpretation or application of a choice of law rule, this is considered a substantive error and, under Swedish law, does not constitute a ground for annulment of an arbitral award. It concluded that the majority had not failed to apply Tanzanian law and that the possibility that the majority may have been in error regarding the meaning of Tanzanian law would not constitute a ground for annulment of the award.",Link,http://www.lcia.org/media/Download.aspx?MediaId=354
36,2013,Sedgman South Africa (Pty) Limited & Ors v DiscoveryCopper Botswana (Pty) Limited,"Supreme Court, Queensland, Australia",1999 Silver,"The Supreme Court of Queensland analysed the meaning of sub-clause 14.6 of an amended Silver Book, in particular, the words ‘payments due’. Sedgman contracted to design and construct parts of the Boseto Copper Project in Botswana for Discovery Copper. Sedgman applied for an interim payment of USD 20 million. Amended sub-clause 14.6 required Discovery Copper to give notice within 7 days if they disagreed with any items in the application. Discovery Copper failed to give the notice and did not contest the application until 14 days later. Sedgman applied to the Court for payment of the sum claimed. The Court dismissed Sedgman’s application for payment, holding that there was a genuine dispute and that Sedgman’s interpretation of the contract was incorrect. The Court held that: ‘This contract did not entitle the applicants to be paid the sum which they now claim, simply from the fact that there was no response to their interim claim within the period of seven days stipulated in the contract.’ McMurdo J considered the words ‘payments due shall not be withheld’ at sub-clause 14.6 of the contract and stated that they were ‘different from saying that a payment will become due if a notice of disagreement is not given,’ as Sedgman contended. The Judge held: ‘The alternative view [...] is that it does not make a payment due. Rather, it governs payments which, by the operation of another term or terms, have [already] become due.’ The Judge stated that, if Sedgman were correct, the operation of the contract clauses to determine claims and variations could otherwise be displaced by the operation of sub-clause 14.6. If the contractor included a claim in his application for payment which was inconsistent with, e.g., a DAB’s determination, and the employer did not notify disagreement, the outcome would be that the DAB’s determination would be displaced",Link,http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/qld/QSC/2013/105.html?stem=0&synonyms=0&query=FIDIC#fnB1

The dispute related to the scope of a consultancy agreement, which contained conflicting dispute resolution clauses. The project was for the construction of two hospitals in the Turks and Caicos Islands. In August 2006 the defendant engaged the plaintiff to provide preliminary drawings for the scheme. On 11 January 2008 the defendant entered into a subcontract (with the main contractor) to design, and construct works for the two hospitals. In April 2008 the plaintiff and defendant signed a consultancy agreement. The plaintiff claimed for certain additional works at the request of the defendant, which claim it split between fees due for services rendered prior to 11 January 2008 and those post 11 January 2008. The defendant maintained that the consultancy agreement contained an exclusive adjudication clause and applied for a stay for adjudication. The plaintiff argued that the adjudication clause was not incorporated into the consultancy agreement, and in the event that it was, the clause would only apply to the fees post 11 January 2008. Three questions considered by the court: (1) was the subcontract’s adjudication clause incorporated into the consultancy agreement; (2) was it enforceable; and (3) whether or not to order a stay of proceedings. The court held that the consultancy agreement was the governing contract, of which the incorporated terms from the subcontract became part. The court noted that clause 12: contained a mandatory provision for reference to adjudication; stated that the reference to adjudication shall be on the same basis as SC 19 of the subcontract; and stated that the adjudicator’s decision is final. The court held that this suggested that the dispute resolution process concludes with adjudication and was not intended to extend to arbitration and confirmed that the subcontract was incorporated into the consultancy agreement and thus enforceable. As regards to a stay of proceedings, on the basis that the issue as to whether or not the consultancy agreement covered both parts of the fees, was still undecided and in the event that the plaintiff was correct in that regard, that part of the claim would not be subject to the consultancy agreement and could not be stayed On this basis, and the defendant’s failure to refer to the matter for adjudication, the court refused the application for a stay.",Link,http://www.adjudication.co.uk/archive/view/case/1455/term/fidic/sam_abbas_&_anthony_hayes_t/a_a_h_design_v_rotary_(international)_limited_%5b2012%5d_niqb_41/

(the Contractor) and SC E.B. SA (the Employer) over the interpretation of Sub-Clause 13.8 (Updates Generated by Price Changes). The dispute was how to determine the correct reference date for calculating the RON/euro exchange rate, which affected the contract price. The Contractor argued that the reference date should be 29 November 2008, while the contract was signed on 25 February 2009, during a period of significant exchange rate fluctuations. This discrepancy led to a disagreement over the adjusted contract price. The dispute involved specific legal provisions, particularly those relating to public procurement and Order No. 915/2008, which imposed the use of FIDIC-type contracts (1999 Red, Yellow, and Green Books) in public procurement. The contract emphasized the mandatory use of these provisions in FIDIC contracts, which are standard in Romanian construction works. The arbitral tribunal ruled in favour of the Contractor, stating that the reference date for determining the RON/EUR equivalence was 29 November 2008. This decision was based on the tender's terms that required bidders to express the offer value in both RON and Euros, fixed at a specific reference date due to import equipment prices. The Employer contested the tribunal's decision and filed to annul the award, arguing that the dispute should be resolved by judicial courts as public procurement disputes fall under the mandatory jurisdiction of judicial courts according to Romanian law. The Employer also claimed that the arbitration agreement was void and the arbitral decision had violated legislation. The Bucharest Court of Appeal dismissed the annulment action, affirming that the arbitration was valid under Order No. 915/2008.

Respondent sought Claimant's agreement to the appointment of a DAB but Claimant never answered this request. Respondent ultimately applied to the president of FIDIC for such appointment, pursuant to clause 20.3, and the sole DAB member that was appointed proceeded to issue two decisions.

The Court decided that the time for completion was not stated in the contract as required by Russian law which provides that time for completion must either be specified by a calendar date or through an inevitable event. As a result there was no contract formed between the parties and the Contractor had to pay the Sub-contractor and return the retention money. However, the amount of interest claimed by the Sub-contractor was reduced by the Court as there was no basis for claiming such interest in Russian law.

The overall dispute is not a FIDIC dispute, but the contract underpinning the dispute was a FIDIC contract. Aveng, in a joint venture with a Lebanese company, entered into a FIDIC contract with the then Government of Swaziland (the third respondent and Employer) for the construction of a road. The contract, under clauses 22.1, 22.2, and 22.3, specified that the Employer ""shall indemnify the Contractor against all claims, etc in respect of inter alia, the unavoidable result of the execution and completion of the works"". During the course of the works, the Contractor caused damages by blasting. The first respondent sought damages for this under clauses 22.1, 22.2, and 22.3, and filed a claim against 'Grienaker', a non-existent company, under the incorrect assumption that 'Grienaker' was the Contractor. The correct company was 'Grinaker', which eventually changed its name to 'Aveng'. Because the respondents had sued a non-existent company, 'Grienaker' was not able to provide a defence in court. The respondents therefore obtained default judgment against 'Grienaker', and, assuming that Aveng was the legal successor of 'Grienaker', attempted to attach Aveng's assets based on this. Aveng applied to set aside the default judgment and interdict the respondents from attaching Aveng's assets. Aveng provided evidence of its name changes and argued that the lawsuit against 'Grienaker' should hold no standing, as the lawsuit should have been against Grinaker or subsequently Aveng. Aveng pointed out that the respondents' counsel were informed of their error but proceeded with the attachment regardless. Aveng also objected as the Government of Swaziland should have been involved in the original lawsuit. The court granted the application on grounds that the respondents had made a fundamental error in the company name.

It held that (1a) the variation was a breach of contract because it limited the Engineer's authority to omit works if the works are omitted from the contract but are not intended to be omitted from the project (i.e., because they are intended to be built by the Employer himself or another contractor). However, the AT also held that (1b) the breach only gave rise to a claim for damages. The second question was whether (2) the Employer's breach of an express duty to arrange works with other contractors other than the contracted Works, (e.g., when the project is divided in lots, or an implied duty thereto), gives rise to a fundamental breach of a fundamental term of the contract. The test for fundamental breach in the country relied on conduct being such as would cause a reasonable person to conclude that the party did not intend to or was unable to fulfil its contract. The test for England relied on whether the party was deprived of a substantial part of the benefit of the contract.

Rolls Royce claimed that there was a duty owed to the operator and sought to rely on limitation of liability clauses in its contract with its Employer. Rolls Royce sought to argue that it could have no greater liability to a third party for defects in the works than it would have to its own employer. The Court of Appeal found that while loss to the operator may have been foreseeable as a consequence of any negligence by the contractor, the relevant contractual matrix within which any duty of care arose precluded a relationship of proximity.

43,2003,Case No. T 8735-01,Svea Court of Appeal,Not specified,"The Appellant challenged an Award rendered pursuant a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between the Netherlands and the Czech Republic on the following grounds: 1) One of the Arbitrators had been excluded from the deliberations; 2) The AT failed to apply the law it was obliged to, according to the BIT; 3) The AT was lacking jurisdiction and, according to lis pendens and res judicata, the AT had exceeded its mandate; 4) The AT applied the joint tortfeasors principle, not submitted by the parties; 5) The AT determined the amount of damages in violation of the parties' instructions to limit the dispute to the existence of liability for damage; 6) The AT applied the provisions of the BIT not covered by the Arbitration Agreement; and 7) the Award rendered violated public policy. Held: The Court rejected the Appeal and did not grant a leave for review of its judgment by the Supreme Court of Sweden on the following grounds: 1) The Chairman of the AT was responsible to issue the Award without delay and had given the arbitrators sufficient time to submit comments. The arbitrator who allegedly was excluded from the deliberations received all essential communications between the other arbitrators and therefore could not be deemed excluded from the deliberations. 2) In principle the AT exceeds its mandate when it applies a different law in violation with the choice-of-law clause. As the AT's interpretation of the wording in the clause allowed the AT to consider other sources of law, they were relevant to the dispute. 3) A fundamental condition for lis pendens and res judicata is party identity. Here, the identity of a minority shareholder did not equate to the identity of the company. 4) The AT did not apply the 'joint tortfeasors' concept. The State may be held liable for damages suffered by an investor, notwithstanding that the State is not alone in causing the damage. 5) The Appellant waived its right to challenge the mandate of the AT. 6) The Appellant should have raised its objections as to the new claim during the arbitration proceedings. 7) In accordance with section 43, second paragraph of the Arbitration Act, the Court of Appeal's decision regarding a claim against an arbitration award pursuant to sections 33 and 34 of the same Act may not be appealed as during the proceeding it failed to object that the claims fell outside of the BIT.

The Contract provided for a tunnel to be lined with any one of six forms of permanent lining, the precise form to be determined at the Engineers' option during the course of the works as and when the geological characteristics of the strata through which the tunnel was driven became known. The BoQ contained estimates of the lengths over which each form of lining would have to be used. In this case the estimates proved to be inaccurate by considerable margins. The Claimant contended that it was unreasonable to apply the rates for the estimated quantities to the rates for the actual (As-Built) quantities and that the latter should be higher rates to be determined upon the basis that the actual quantities constituted a variation. Held: Allowing the Respondent's appeal that on the true construction of the contract mere differences in quantities from those billed as estimated did not constitute a variation since the Claimant had undertaken to construct the scope at the option of the Engineer, at the rates contained in the BoQ.
